5,2017-01-11 00:53:36,5n8z88,46129,60241,5n8z88,Megathread: Intelligence report claims Russia has compromising information on Trump,0.71,11060,5,"Summary I came up with:

*Of the Buzzfeed dossier. As of yet, unverified -- but I would trust the reporting rolling in from reputable sources, [namely CNN:] (http://www.cnn.com/2017/01/10/politics/donald-trump-intelligence-report-russia/index.html) The Russians have attempted over a long period of time to compromise Trump with damaging financial and personal info. They obtained info on this operation from an ex-MI6 agent with connections in Russia and Europe. Intelligence pared the raw data they got from the agent down to a two-page dossier that was given to POTUS, PEOTUS, and the ""Gang of 8"" select members of Congress. 

>8+ years of communication between him and Kremlin, and 5+ year relationship of cultivating/supporting/assisting Trump by Russia.
 
>They offered him real estate deals IN RUSSIA to further ensnare him, but he declined.
 
>Russia has dirt on Trump hiring Russian prostitutes give golden showers to each other while he watched, supposedly in the room that was bugged with mics and cameras to record the event.

>**Several users mentioned that we should shift focus away from this, funny as the allegation may be, towards what really matters in this story. The allegations of bribery/blackmail/collusion with a hostile power are what have real teeth here, and what would be most damning claims if proven true. If anyone asks, I would describe those as the meat of the story in order to keep it serious instead of opening with a pee joke or something. But this is just their opinion, and I tend to agree.**

>Detailed claims of bilateral intelligence sharing back and forth between Trump and Putin. Trump had DNC moles and used US as well as foreign hackers. Trump got info on his opponents, Putin got info on Russian oligarchs + families living in US.

>They used the pension system that Russian diplomats used to transfer information back and forth to/from each other as well. It mentions tens of thousands of dollars were sent in addition to the money.
 
>Russia's main goal appears to be driving wedges to cause divisions in the West. They aided Jill Stein, Carter Page and Michael Flynn (the latter two being members of Trump's team) in doing so. 
 
>Main goal of DNC emails appeared to be swinging Sanders voters to Trump.

>Russia and Trump had a mutual agreement on the DNC hack. Russia released the emails to Wikileaks in return for Trump removing mention of Russian invasion of Crimea in favor of talking about NATO financial commitments in Eastern Europe and the Baltics. Putin wanted people to stop talking Ukraine while also undermining NATO.

>Trump's most damning financial commitments are actually in China and other emerging markets. He's paid large bribes and kickbacks there that would've destroyed his campaign if made public.

>Hilariously, when Trump said he had few Russian financial investments, that was true, but he has actively sought them out only to be denied. He apparently settled for extensive sexual favors there instead
 
>Trump lawyer Cohen had clandestine meeting with Kremlin operatives in August, held in Prague to try to make it seem less suspicious.
 
>Ukrainian President that Putin installed confided to Putin he DID provide ex-campaign manager Manafort w/ kickbacks that were previously reported. Left no paper trail.
 
>Russia pissed this has gotten so much media coverage. They hoped to push for improved Russian-US relationships regardless of who was elected. Ancillary goal with Clinton was to drive her positions further from Obama's in event she won - they're happy both candidates were anti-TPP because they viewed that as bad for them.
 
>Trump has bribed Russian business interests but worked diligently to obfuscate and eliminate paper trail. Also engaged in Russian sex parties but has likewise bribed or coerced witnesses to be silent. They do believe a particular Russian businessman was intricately linked to Trump would know details.
 
>Manafort/Page/Cohen all highly compromised. They/Trump were apparently offered up to 19% stake in Russian STATE-OWNED oil company Rosneft by its president if they could successfully get Western Russian sanctions lifted. Page expressed interest in this deal, saying sanctions would be lifted.
 
>Once the sh*t started to hit the fan, Cohen was heavily involved in trying to cover up the relationship between Carter/Manafort/himself and Russia.

>Mentions that the Trump team AND Russia both paid Romanian hackers to help sabotage Democrats.
 
>Overall goal of electing Trump was to destabilize Western and world order in Russia's favor since he was anti-establishment and so divisive.

I feel it pertinent to mention that CNN mentioned when this broke that the Buzzfeed story and intel therein ARE unverified, BUT US intel officials consider both the ex-MI6 agent source and his Russian sources credible. I'm guessing our intelligence is working to verify or disprove this now, since Comey would not answer when asked if the FBI was currently investigating Russia-campaign connections on Capital hill today.

Let me know if something needs added or if I screwed something up. 

Additions: Damn, this thing grew into a team effort. Thanks to everybody who put in work.

[Excellent post] (https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/5n8z88/megathread_intelligence_report_claims_russia_has/dc9lwcx/) from u/aubonpaine with loads of sources about more details on everything, notably that Roger Stone was also a point man for Assange.

Twitter user @chris_ baugh_ put together [a great timeline] (https://twitter.com/chris_baugh_/status/818998378285580292) that ties everything together.

u/JustDandy07 is the man. Added a bunch of stuff.

u/whiskystoned, u/sylviecerise and u/TyrionLan1ster made sure I had my TPP bit correct - Russia was AGAINST TPP.

u/Adrian_Bock raised a great point. Trump specifically used Presidential Suite in Russian Ritz-Carlton where Obama/Michelle stayed for his golden shower episode(s) to defile the bed. That's some depraved shit.

u/niknight_ml mentioned that Trump may have helped actually fund the DNC hack itself.

u/pollo_bueno reminded me Rosneft is Russian Government-owned oil.

Edit: Very worthwhile post from u/RedditDawson

>Worth mentioning:

>Trump supporters are brigading this thread claiming it's all a 4chan troll. There's no proof 4chan is behind this.

>4chan user claims to have been sending info to US official as the source for this document

>(Rick Wilson whom they are saying they sent it to is denying he is the source or the /pol/ had anything to do with it).

>https://twitter.com/TheRickWilson/status/819000073853997056

>And now there are many Photoshopped screencaps from the document with outrageous scenarios in attempt to discredit the original

Lastly, if you care about investigating this, I'd urge you to call your Senators and ask them to support [Senate Bill 27] (https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/senate-bill/27?r=1), which calls for the establishment of an independent panel to investigate Russia's cyberattacks. McConnell seems completely feckless in this regard and we've all seen the way Congressional investigations can go. I personally feel a non-partisan panel would be the best option.

im not even gonna bother with 2016.  

if his supporters would just come out and admit that they like russia more than america i would have an easier time understanding where they're coming from.  

you cannot be both a patriot and a trump supporter.  

i know they think that they're the most patriotic of all, but teddy roosevelt would disagree;


“Patriotism,” said Theodore Roosevelt, “means to stand by the country. It does not mean to stand by the President or any other public official save exactly to the degree in which he himself stands by the country. … Every man,” said President Roosevelt, “who parrots the cry of ‘stand by the President’ without adding the proviso ‘so far as he serves the Republic’ takes an attitude as essentially unmanly as that of any Stuart royalist who championed the doctrine that the King could do no wrong. No self-respecting and intelligent free man could take such an attitude.” 

or perhaps you prefer this one where Roosevelt gives us the TL;DR version;

“To announce that there must be no criticism of the President, or that we are to stand by the President, right or wrong, is not only unpatriotic and servile, but is morally treasonable to the American public.”

    ― Theodore Roosevelt

This idea that we're counting on corporations to look out for us when their stated purpose is *self interest*, not our interests, and that the government that we choose to represent us is subservient to their interests runs totally counter to how our democracy ought to work.

96,2017-01-13 15:54:32,5nrcvo,8121,30598,5nrcvo,AP Source: Trump aide in frequent contact with Russia envoy,0.72,4931,1,"This is now two sources - the AP and David Ignatius - confirming the fact that Michael Flynn was in contact with the Russian Ambassador multiple times on the day Obama expelled 35 Russian diplomats as punishment for hacking.

**EDIT**:  Sean Spicer has [now acknowledged](https://twitter.com/alivitali/status/819939967392739331) that the contact on Dec. 28 b/w Flynn and the Russian Ambassador did, in fact, take place.  He claims that Flynn was arranging for a call to take place between Trump and Putin soon after the inauguration.  

So we're supposed to believe that the incoming ~~Director of the~~ NSC Advisor is the person in the Trump transition who is tasked with arranging phone calls and scheduling matters for the President-Elect.  

Finally, I'll note that the fact that this information leaked is evidence that the US government may be tracking Flynn's phone calls, most likely pursuant to a FISA warrant.  The only other ways for this info to have come out is if somebody close to Flynn was in the room when the contact took place and leaked it, or if the Russian Ambassador is under U.S. surveillance (probably the other feasible scenario).

**EDIT 2**:  Just wanted to add the text of the [Logan Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logan_Act) for everybody to review and be aware of.  In a sane government where representatives cared more about country than party, this situation would, at the very least, trigger a serious Congressional investigation into whether the Logan Act was violated:

>Any citizen of the United States, wherever he may be, who, without authority of the United States, directly or indirectly commences or carries on any correspondence or intercourse with any foreign government or any officer or agent thereof, with intent to influence the measures or conduct of any foreign government or of any officer or agent thereof, in relation to any disputes or controversies with the United States, or to defeat the measures of the United States, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than three years, or both.

Trumpers Silent As He Fills His Administration With ‘Globalists’,0.69,8821,14,"Stuff like this is why you have liberals like me who say that this election was about racial and social issues, and questions of pure dominance. Because this sort of crap makes a mockery out of any other explanation of this election.

If you think back to what the election was *claimed* (and I suppose still claimed) to be about, it's simply not explanatory of the result. If you think about the three main criticisms that people had of Hillary, Trump is making a mockery of all of them.

* Hillary was corrupt? Trump is shaping up to be - by far - the most corrupt President in history. He's not even trying to hide it. He's openly, flagrantly, *proudly* corrupt. Not only did he not divest himself of his business interests, he's not even *pretending* to distance himself from it. He literally puts his daughter - someone with zero experience running anything at all other than the family business - on diplomatic phone calls. She's going to run stuff. Maybe I shouldn't be shocked at this stuff, but I can't not be. His selection for Secretary of Treasury *literally said the reason he supported Trump in the election was that Trump would appoint him to office*. It's graft of the highest order. The idea that anyone didn't vote for Hillary because of her *personal corruption*, while voting for Trump, is so absurd as to make your head spin.

* Hillary was too close to business interests/wall street? Well, this is a joke. Trump is appointing the business elite of this country to run the country. He put a Goldman Sachs partner in treasury. He put the freaking CEO of Exxon as Secretary of State. Again - the idea that anyone would not vote for Hillary, or vote for Trump, out of a concern of being too close to wall street and big business is Orwellian.

* Hillary was sloppy with intelligence? Do I even need to start on this one? Trump openly mocks and derides intelligence briefings. He has appointed people with *zero* national security experience into positions of leading those organizations. He has already been conducting state business on unsecured phone lines. Does anyone actually think Trump is going to meticulously obey government IT protocol once in office? I know I'm a broken record, but the idea that Trump is going to be *more careful* with our intelligence agencies than Hillary is absurd beyond belief.

So people like me look at this and - I think fairly - conclude that the election *was never about these issues*. The are post-hoc rationalizations people had for hating Hillary and voting for Trump. There's just no other plausible explanation.

This is a serious mockery of everything this country is supposed to be about, especially things conservatives are supposed to be about. There is basically no substance to the GOP anymore. It's just about power and who holds it. That's it. What they do with it? Who cares."

1. Who, exactly, in MSM or in any reputable sphere really is actually going to take innocent statements out of context and attack her with them? Who could you possibly picture doing something that career damaging and useless?

2. How exactly would Sanders or any opponent for that matter be able to hurt her with statements that are truly taken out of context? Outlets like WaPo and Politifact and other MSM pundits will shut them all down. Add that to the simple fact that you really can't hurt someone with innocuous statements (especially not someone like Clinton, who has had it all thrown at her and has the highest degree of plausible deniability on situations like this out of anyone out there).

3. How is there anything to gain from allowing yourself to be constantly attacked for *not* releasing them when, if they truly are innocent, releasing them would help you with by far your ***biggest*** issue among voters: trust, honest, and transparency?

It makes literally no sense whatsoever not to release them... unless they *are* objectively damaging.

138,2016-10-27 02:18:33,59lcba,3479,28096,59lcba,Bernie Sanders is trying to single handedly kill AT&T's $85 billion purchase of Time Warner,0.84,1884,0,"Senator Bernie Sanders Letter on proposed AT&T & Time Warner Merger: 

>Dear Acting Assistant Attorney General Hesse:


>I am writing to urge you to block the proposed merger of AT&T Inc. and Time Warner Inc. This proposed merger is just the latest effort to shrink our media landscape, stifle competition and diversity of content, and provide consumers with less while charging them more.


>Whether to approve this merger is a critical decision for the Department, but it is even more consequential for our democracy. Our democracy thrives when there is a diversity of viewpoints, and when citizens have unlimited access to information. Analysts have called the proposed deal a ""seismic shift"" for the media and technology sectors, while a giant telephone company ""gaining control over hugely valuable brands spanning television, film, sports, news, video games and mobile and residential Internet service."" As you noted recently when speaking about the corrosive effects of antitrust, ""when companies harm competition – they infect the economy with unfairness by accumulating power that the few can wield at the expense of the broader American public."" This merger represents a gross concentration of power that runs counter to the public good and should be blocked.


>Consideration of this deal should recieve the utmost scrutiny, particularly because it involves a sector so fundamental to a free democracy. As Robert Weissman of Public Citizen notes, ""this merger aims to concentrate far too much market, communications, and political power in one corporation, threatening to impede the free flow of information, undermine the integrity of the Internet, raise consumer prices and further corrupt our politics."" In this particular merger, the diversity of programming would be further diminished by truncating the relationship of content and distribution. When one giant company owns both the content and the means of distribution there is a clear disincentive to provide additional choices to consumers. In these so-called ""vertical relationships,"" not only is competition reduced, but there is a heightened, if not insurmountable, barrier to the influx of new content and diverse voices.


>Moreover, this proposed deal is likely to allow the CEO of Time Warner to earn hundreds of millions of dollars on the stocks and options he has accrued, and to saddle the combined company upwards of $175 billion of debt it will have to service on the backs of consumers. That would be simply unacceptable.


>As we have seen, newly merged companies have used their scale and market power to raise prices on consumers and lower compensation for their completing producers. This would would almost certainly lead to price hikes and reduced choice. We have seen the effects on consumers play out in AT&T's 2016 acquisition of DirecTV. AT&T claimed that such a deal would benefit consumers. Almost a year later, these benefits are nowhere to be found, and AT&T raised prices for DirecTV services. We have also seen increased anti-competitive behavior resulting from the AT&T-DirecTV merger. For example, AT&T has exempted its DirecTV service from data caps to consumers, in ways that are already arguably a violation of net neutrality principles.


>Finally, approving this deal could lead to a wave of other mergers in the media industry. At a time when our telecommunications and media industries are already too concentrated, we should be focused on opening those markets to more competition, not less.


>The media and telecommunications landscape is changing. It is important that public policy concerns guide these changes, so that we may preserve our democratic discourse and open competitive markets for speech and commerce. That is the function of our antitrust laws. I ask you to enforce them and block the proposed merger. 


>Sincerely, 

>Bernie Sanders"

Edit 2: if anyone is really interested about inequity when it comes to criminal justice in america I recommend Matt Taibi's book [The Divide:  American Injustice in the Age of the Wealth](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17834864-the-divide) though I will warn you it is seriously enraging.  

>""In ""The Divide, ""Matt Taibbi takes readers on a galvanizing journey through both sides of our new system of justice--the fun-house-mirror worlds of the untouchably wealthy and the criminalized poor. He uncovers the startling looting that preceded the financial collapse; a wild conspiracy of billionaire hedge fund managers to destroy a company through dirty tricks; and the story of a whistleblower who gets in the way of the largest banks in America, only to find herself in the crosshairs.""

Edit 3: as u/PhNxHellfire reminded me, the book / documentary, [Too big too Fail](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6687247-too-big-to-fail) and the book / movie [The Big Short](http://m.imdb.com/title/tt1596363/) provide interesting (and entertaining) perspective on the events too.

-----------------

[Updated: The Facts About Hillary Clinton’s Emails](https://www.hillaryclinton.com/briefing/factsheets/2015/07/13/email-facts/)

-------------------------

#With respect to her setup being allowed:

> Her usage was widely known to the over 100 State Department and U.S. government colleagues she emailed, **consistent with the practice of prior Secretaries of State and permitted at the time.**

> Was it allowed?

> Yes. The laws, regulations, **and State Department policy in place during her tenure permitted her to use a non-government email for work.**

Blatantly false, as per the IG's report (source: NYT):

> [The State Department’s inspector general sharply criticized Hillary Clinton’s exclusive use of a private email server while she was secretary of state, **saying she had not sought permission to use it and would not have received it if she had.**](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/26/us/politics/state-department-hillary-clinton-emails.html?_r=0)

[As per pg. 39-40 of the OIG report:] (https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/2842429/ESP-16-03-Final.pdf)

> Secretary Clinton used mobile devices to conduct official business using the personal email account on her private server extensively, as illustrated by the 55,000 pages of material making up the approximately 30,000 emails she provided to the Department in December 2014. **Throughout Secretary Clinton’s tenure, the FAM stated that normal day-to-day operations should be conducted on an authorized AIS,147 yet OIG found no evidence that the Secretary requested or obtained guidance or approval to conduct official business via a personal email account on her private server. According to the current CIO and Assistant Secretary for Diplomatic Security, *Secretary Clinton had an obligation to discuss using her personal email account to conduct official business with their offices*, who in turn would have attempted to provide her with approved and secured means that met her business needs. However, according to these officials, *DS and IRM did not—and would not—approve her exclusive reliance on a personal email account to conduct Department business*, because of the restrictions in the FAM and the security risks in doing so.**

As as per Bloomberg:

> [Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton’s use of a private e-mail system while she was secretary of state violated State Department rules, the agency’s inspector general concluded](http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2016-05-25/clinton-e-mail-use-violated-rules-state-department-audit-finds)

Also extremely suspicious, as per pg. 43 of the OIG report:

>According to the staff member, the Director stated that the Secretary's personal system had been reviewed and approved by Department legal staff and that the matter was not to be discussed any further.

> As previously noted, **OIG found no evidence that staff in the Office of the Legal Adviser reviewed or approved Secretary Clinton’s personal system.** 

> According to the other S/ES-IRM staff member who raised concerns about the server, **the Director stated that the mission of S/ES-IRM is to support the Secretary and instructed the staff never to speak of the Secretary’s personal email system again.**

Concerns were raised, a review was lied about, and then those who were concerned were told never to bring it up again.

---------

#With respect to fully cooperating with public servants investigating her server setup:

> We understand that members of her State Department staff were recently asked to assist the Department in its record-keeping by providing any work-related emails they may have on personal accounts. They have received requests from Rep. Gowdy as well.

> Clinton is proud of the work of all the dedicated public servants that were part of her team at the State Department. She was proud of her aides then and is proud of them now, **as they have committed - *as she has* - to being as helpful as possible in responding to requests.**

Blatantly false as per Bloomberg:

> [**Clinton declined to speak with investigators, according to the report, as did at least three key aides:** former Chief of Staff Cheryl Mills, former Director of Policy Planning Jake Sullivan, who is now a top aide on the campaign, and former Deputy Chief of Staff Huma Abedin, who now serves as the campaign vice chairwoman.] (http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2016-05-25/clinton-e-mail-use-violated-rules-state-department-audit-finds)

Relevant section of the OIG report:
> 
> Finally, OIG interviewed Secretary Kerry and former Secretaries Albright, Powell, and Rice. Through her
> counsel, **Secretary Clinton declined OIG’s request for an interview.** ^7
> 
> 
> 
> **^7 In addition to Secretary Clinton, eight former Department employees declined OIG requests for interviews:** (1) the
> Chief of Staff to Secretary Powell (2002-05); (2) the Counselor and Chief of Staff to Secretary Clinton (2009-13); (3) the
> Deputy Chief of Staff for Policy to Secretary Clinton (2009-11) and the Director of Policy Planning (2011-13); (4) the
> Deputy Chief of Staff for Operations to Secretary Clinton (2009-13); (5) the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Strategic
> Communication (2009-13); (6) the Director of the S/ES Office of Information Resources Management (2008-13); (7) a
> Special Advisor to the Deputy Chief Information Officer (2009-13) who provided technical support for Secretary
> Clinton’s personal email system; and (8) a Senior Advisor to the Department, who supervised responses to
> Congressional inquiries (2014-15). Two additional individuals did not respond to OIG interview requests: the Deputy
> Secretary of State for Management and Resources (2011-13) and an individual based in New York who provided
> technical support for Secretary Clinton’s personal email system but who was never employed by the Department.

------------------------------

#With respect to handing over all her emails:

> Following conversations with State Department officials and in response to the State Department's 2014 letter to former Secretaries, Clinton directed her attorneys to assist by identifying and preserving all emails that could potentially be federal records. This entailed a multi-step process to review each email and provide printed copies of Clinton's emails to the State Department, erring on the side of including anything that might be even potentially work-related.

Blatantly false, as per pg. 26 of the OIG report:

> At a minimum, Secretary Clinton should have surrendered all emails dealing with Department business before leaving government service and, **because she did not do so**, she did not comply with the Department’s policies that were implemented in accordance with the Federal Records Act.

-------------------------------

#With respect to being hacked:

> Was the server ever hacked?

> No, there is no evidence there was ever a breach.

They are right in saying that there is no *publicly available* evidence of a breach, but this is *highly* misleading, as per pg. 40 of the OIG report:

> In another incident occurring on May 13, 2011, **two of Secretary Clinton’s immediate staff discussed via email the Secretary’s concern that someone was “hacking into her email” after she received an email with a suspicious link. Several hours later, Secretary Clinton received an email from the personal account of then-Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs that also had a link to a suspect website. The next morning, Secretary Clinton replied to the email with the following message to the Under Secretary: “Is this really from you? I was worried about opening it!”** Department policy requires employees to report cybersecurity incidents to IRM security officials when any improper cyber-security practice comes to their attention. 12 FAM 592.4 (January 10, 2007). **Notification is required when a user suspects compromise of, among other things, a personally owned device containing personally identifiable information. 12 FAM 682.2-6 (August 4, 2008).** ***However, OIG found no evidence that the Secretary or her staff reported these incidents to computer security personnel or anyone else within the Department***

Also as per pg. 43 of the OIG report:

> On January 9, 2011, the non-Departmental advisor to President Clinton who provided technical support to the Clinton email system notified the Secretary’s Deputy Chief of Staff for Operations that he had to shut down the server because he believed “someone was trying to hack us and while they did not get in i didnt [sic] want to let them have the chance to.” Later that day, the advisor again wrote to the Deputy Chief of Staff for Operations, **“We were attacked again so I shut [the server] down for a few min.”** On January 10, the Deputy Chief of Staff for Operations emailed the Chief of Staff and the Deputy Chief of Staff for Planning and instructed them not to email the Secretary “anything sensitive” and stated that she could “explain more in person.

[State Department Spokesman Toner retracting his statement that the OIG report proves Clinton wasn't hacked, saying he ""misspoke"".] (https://youtu.be/jSrSHG_Is9I?t=1365)

Again, this is not *conclusive evidence* that the server was hacked, but it exposes Team Clinton as being disingenuous about this point on a whole other level with their lawyer-talk because [it's actually far more likely at this point that she *was* hacked.] (https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/4l64ra/megathread_state_department_email_audit_re/d3ksndy) There's also literally nothing that speaks to the idea Clinton wasn't hacked (apart from the mere absence of publicly available, conclusive proof).

Anyone who seeks to excuse blatant dishonesty of this calibre needs to give their head a shake. This should be disqualifying."

Putin loves trump because trump is all about big oil and clean coal (if there is such a thing)

ExxonMobileUSA and russia currently have a agreement to share oil from a new site in the arctic circle.    This location was previously covered in ICE, and unsuitable for drilling.   

Due to global warming over the past 50 years, the ice in the arctic circle is quickly melting, and thus opened this spot where oil was found.  

Russia has a claim to the land, but only ExxonMobile USA has the technology to extract the oil out of these desolate conditions.

This Exxon/Russia deal was put on hold due to USA Sanctions against russia for their activities in Ukraine.   Russia needs money, their economy crashed last year.   They need the arctic circle deal. 

Enter Trump:  Trump appoints ExxonMobile CEO Tillerson as Secretary of State, and also nominates Scott Pruitte, a staunch opponent of the EPA over the years, and who currently has 3 lawsuits against the EPA over coal regulations. 

Trump is aiming to strip the EPA of it's power and agenda, un-do the Arctic Circle sanctions, Tillerson, Pruitt, Putin, Trump all stand to make a lot of money.    

The human race will pay for trump's choices in the end..  Coal factories will start back up, Solar power will see regulation (we can't have customers selling energy), and our environment will continue to get warmer. All of this to make a buck, and to ensure your rich share-holders continue to get those famous EXXON Dividends.

Edit: First, thanks for the gold! Second, a lot of people are asking what's bad about voter ID laws. I'm not an expert on this and haven't looked into it a lot, but what my understanding of the issue is this - In a perfect world requiring ID at the voting booth would be no biggie. But the world isn't perfect, and there are a lot of people that don't have an ID, don't have the time and money to get it easily. This group, which is mostly lower income, already has very bad voter turnout. There is very little dispute that voter ID laws disproportionately affect the Democratic demographic. It opens up the possibility of states and districts to make it intentionally harder to get the ID, making it harder to vote.

So basically my opinion: **this is a solution to a non existent problem that will make some groups of people feel like it's more time consuming to vote, so they don't.** If along with requiring ID they make sure that everyone, everywhere, can get an ID for free without taking time off work then I'm fine with it. If it turns out that millions voted illegally then I agree something needs to be done. But voter turnout in the 2016 election was 55%, they need to get more people to vote, not fewer."

It's obvious that he is mocking this particular *disabled* reporter, whom he knew.

Trump's having mocked others in some ridiculous way is not a defense for how he mocked Kovaleski. In fact, it makes Trump out even worse than just this one incident for any number of reasons.

If the American economy tanks it won't matter for Clinton or Trump or most of the politicians in washington, it will almost only affect the middle class and poor. Most politicians are invested in multiple world stock markets. If Americas economy tanks, then they can capitalize in some other economy, if the world economy tanks then they're still on top. The government is literally a group of people manipulating the world for financial gains and not really trying to better society.

First of all, a President calling someone else a clown, through twitter, blows my fucking mind still. I'll never get used to him acting like a thin skinned 2 year old. Never. 

Secondly, I still do not understand how any adult human could trust anything that comes out of his mouth. He will literally word salad you in direct conflict with ***his own words*** that he just said a few moments earlier, and expect you to believe him. 

It's fucking insane... "

>I'm going to share this every time there is a thread where Guliani thinks anything he has to say is relevant:

>I wish people would remember this story: After the 1993 WTC bombings, the FDNY found that some of their radios would not work inside the towers. For the next 8 years they requested upgraded radio systems so that they could communicate more effectively on the scene of incidents like that, should they ever happen again. Guliani pushed against these requests, and they were never given better radios.

>When the first tower came down, an evacuation of the second tower was called. All FDNY and NYPD personnel were to try and leave the building before it's too late. But, the radios didn't work. Many, many firefighters and police never heard the call, and remained inside attempting to rescue people until the second tower collapsed. Guliani doomed these brave people to die inside there because he was stingy about helping them get the equipment they needed, and now he parades around as if he's some sort of hero.

>Guliani got firefighters and police killed on 9/11. Guliani did nothing positive on or after 9/11 to help police and firefighters. He's a fucking ghoul who keeps bringing up that it happened in the city while he was mayor as if that somehow qualifies him for anything, but when you know the truth...emergency servants died because of Guliani and every time he sanctimoniously talks about 9/11 I want to spit in his scumbag face.

I would love to see more elections in the United States start using the single transferable vote method of voting. With this style of voting, you rank the candidate in order of preference. So in the case where one candidate is popular, but polarizing, a plurality will not win the election. Instead, you then count the ballots of those who were voters' second choice, until a candidate gets the majority of votes cast. 

Effectively, this is how Lincoln won the 1860 GOP nomination. He was many delegates' second choice, so once delegates figured out that their nominee was unable to win, they threw their support behind Lincoln, who was in second place after the first vote."

https://youtu.be/BB38DvTV5kc?t=4m40s

edit: upon giving this way more thought then it's worth:

When taken litteraly, the quote can only be interpretted as most of us are interpretting it: Trump says he didn't mean it when he said he wanted to drain the swamp. Proof is in the pudding (in this case the upvotes) language means what people understand it to mean, and majority wins. The end bit I left out ""it's true, etc"" linguisticly, can only refer to the story itself, not the wider issue of fighting corruption, which isn't adressed and ""starting to say it like I meant it"" can only mean that he doesn't mean it, the only place where he IS adressing the underlying meaning, ie. fighting corruption. 

This is, however, when analysing the language as if spoken by a coherent person.

I think it's unlikely Trump is actually trying to say this. I think it's a clumsily worded attempt to tone down the conversation, by getting rid of the most inflammatory taglines of his campaign. This is him trying to be ""presidential"". When asked flat out, Trump would defend that he still wants to fight corruption.

All this is secondary however, only actions count, and there  we've seen Trump announce legislation that would bar lobbyist and then we've seen his list of appointments, who ARE lobbyists or corporate henchmen.

#Final edit (I hope): Bloomberg spun the facts... ^^^^^2:03pm ^^^^^est

[Reuters link - **Papal official denies report Sanders invited himself to Vatican**](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-vatican-idUSKCN0X5257)

>**""This is not true and she knows it. I invited him with her consensus,"" said Sorondo, who is senior to Archer.** ^^Ouch.

It appears Bernie Sanders was [in fact invited](http://www.dailykos.com/story/2016/4/8/1512646/-Bloomberg-News-Vatican-officials-DENY-Archer-account-state-they-issued-invitation-to-Bernie).

>And all that talk of “monumental discourtesy”? Well, it turns out that, again, was all Archer, who felt the fact no one consulted Archer represented said discourtesy...to Archer:

>>“The president of the academy organizing this event has not been contacted with monumental discourtesy,” she said, referring to herself.

>Fortunately, higher Vatican officials publicly rejected the claim:

>The academy’s chancellor said he arranged the invitation and defended the Vermont senator.
Other high-ranking figures concurred, and the Chancellor further elaborated that the invitation is of no recent vintage:

>>Bishop Marcelo Sanchez Sorondo, the chancellor of the Academy, speaking on the phone from New York, said he extended the invitation to Sanders, though he declined to say who initiated the contacts. 

>>“We are interested in having him because we have two presidents coming from Latin America, I thought it would be good to have an authoritative voice from North America,” Sanchez Sorondo said. Asked when he when the invitation was extended, he said, “Quite some time ago.”

>Papal spokesmen did speak out as well, noting that the invitation came from the pontifical academy of social sciences and not from the Pope himself. No meeting between the Vermont Senator and Pope Francis is envisaged “[f]or the moment”.

This is more than speaking to the U.S. political audience, this is an opportunity for Bernie to speak to the world. This is insane. In the interview it sounded like he was invited to give a speech. He's also the only presidential candidate to ever be invited there to give a speech*^^^^Fixed ^^^^some ^^^^wording.

Edit1: He was invited to give a speech on creating a ""moral economy"".

Edit2: Since I'm at the top, here's the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECK9_Bk9IIs) from Morning Joe.

Everyone should set aside some time to watch [***Inequality for All***](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2215151/). A documentary from Robert Reich where he discusses the grave economic and social consequences that may result if the gulf between rich and poor continues to widen.

Robert Reich has made it free to all on [Vimeo - Use the password ""***bernie2016***"" to watch it](https://vimeo.com/141725998). I feel it's relevant to the issues Bernie will be speaking about at the Vatican.

Edit again because I'm on top and people keep mentioning it: ^^^Added ^^^at ^^^~12:45pm ^^^est

It seems something is going on with this story regarding whether or not an invite was given or requested.

Bloomberg posted [this](http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2016-04-08/sanders-accused-of-discourtesy-in-seeking-vatican-invitation) article saying the following: 

>Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders’s plans to attend a Vatican-sponsored conference put him in the middle of a diplomatic row as a senior Vatican official accused Sanders of showing ""monumental discourtesy"" in seeking an invitation and for putting a political cast on the gathering in Rome.

>“Sanders made the first move, for the obvious reasons,” Margaret Archer, president of the Pontifical Academy of Social Sciences, which is hosting the conference Sanders will attend, said in a telephone interview. “I think in a sense he may be going for the Catholic vote but this is not the Catholic vote and he should remember that and act accordingly -- not that he will.”

Shortly after Bloomberg posted [this](http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/trackers/2016-04-08/sanders-aide-disputes-vatican-story-on-lobbied-invitation) link:

>Which has now been changed to say something completely different than it originally did. Originally it said something about the campaign disputing the claims.

And also Fox has posted this: ^^^1:10pm ^^^est

http://fox6now.com/2016/04/08/bernie-sanders-to-visit-vatican-city-days-before-ny-primary/

>Asked if Sanders had requested an invitation, he said, “He has expressed an interest many times in the Pope’s encyclical and it’s clear that he has an interest in studying it. It might have that effect, (of looking like they approve of campaign) but we are not looking to support the campaign.”

It seems Sanders expressed an interest in the past and when this conference was scheduled and they wanted to invite a US politician they invited someone who already expressed an interest in the past.


___ 

Here is a [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/4dx84o/sanders_aide_disputes_vatican_story_on_lobbied/d1v4me6) I found from /u/PeterGibbons2 that is insightful: ^^^1:30pm ^^^est

>Oh for God sakes. I'm Catholic and a Clinton supporter. If Bernie wants to go to the Vatican, **at least he's going to the Vatican.** Whether he was invited or not, he's the person going. It seems like an incredibly petty squabble to try to establish whether he was invited or he requested to go. I don't see Clinton or anyone other 2016 candidates taking the time to attend. Even a request to attend is at least showing a commitment to engaging the Vatican where no other candidates seem to be doing so. 

>It's ridiculous and unbecoming of the Catholic Church for Margaret Archer to claim Bernie's intentions are discourteous and politically motivated. This seems like another classic case of the Vatican's division between Jesuit wing and the old guard. Pope Francis would never say something like that.

>I'm sure the Pope and the Jesuit/reform wing of the Vatican are happy to have any American politician who wants to attend, liberal or conservative. But people like Margaret Archer can't accept that so they have to call out Sanders publicly. 

>Edit: [Also looking at Margaret Archer's work](http://www.endslavery.va/content/endslavery/en/getinvolved/contributions/archer_reply.html), it's hard to associate her with the ""old guard"" here. So I don't know if her criticism of Sanders is ideologically motivated, but regardless of why she's calling him out, it's inexcusable.

The DNC, Hillary campaign, and 32 states.

Voter donation limits to individual campaigns are $2700

Limit Donation to a state Democratic Party is: $10000 per state 

Max donation to the DNC is: $33,400 to the dollar.

32 states have a ""stake"" in her victory fund, meaning they are looking for a return on their investment.

What Hillary is doing currently is having people donating $10000 to each state through this victory fund, and $33400 to the DNC. But the issue is, that most of the money is going into this fund for her campaign, but she promises these states and the DNC a senate majority. That is why superdelegates pledged so early on. This is where the problem is. It is laundering money through this fund into her campaign.

Let's calculate this: $10000 x 32 states = $320,000

$320,000 + $33400 max donation to the DNC = WHAT DO YA KNOW?  $353,400.

Think that clooney dinner donation price was a coincidence?

Edit: She bought the loyalty of superdelegates before Bernie even announced his candidacy, and it's said she funneled more than maximum into her campaign as it stands. That's where the issue is. DNC is supposed to be impartial during this time and essentially coronated her before Bernie even had a chance. He had a 350 delegate gap that he had to make up before the first states even voted.

Edit: yes, she bought their loyalty by taking their state money and then awarding them with seats in the house later on, which is what I mean. Bernie has down ballot selections, but they aren't necessarily establishment democrats.


EDIT: So. 

Given that the Hillary Clinton Victory Fund has specifically disclosed that approximately 28.27% of the funds went to Hillary Clinton (9.5/33.6m) while only 16.37% went down ticket (5.5/33.6m).... 

(And DO note that it mostly went to parties and committees!) 

353,400 * 0.2827 = 99,906.18 directly to Hillary Clinton. 

3, 330.21~ for SOME of the state parties. Not candidates. The party. Specifically. 

Now, the individual campaign contributions limit is 2700. 

99,906.18 / 2700 = 37.002288...

Thirty fucking seven times the individual contributions amount.

They need to take a long look in the mirror because this upcoming term they will not control either house in the legislative branch, the executive branch, or the judiciary branch. Obviously their message this election did not resonate with Americans.

This should be a wakeup call to the Democratic Party that the super delegate system and rigging your own primaries to choose a more flawed candidate, who draws far fewer supporters at rallies and does not equally energize the base, is a recipe for failure in the general election. They chose an elitist in a year that was overwhelming dominated by populism all over the world. Their political strategy for this campaign was a complete failure, and they must adjust the direction of the party if they want to re-gain any meaningful voice in the federal government, because obviously this populist movement is bi-partisan and is here to stay for the foreseeable future."

The SEMI-GOOD NEWS:

He won Nebraska by 57-43 with 88% reporting, which is currently saying [15-10](http://www.thegreenpapers.com/P16/NE-D) for him. That puts him at even on the 538 metric, and +5 on the overall delegate total meaning he's at +18 for the night.

The BAD NEWS:

He lost Louisiana by 71-23 with 100% reporting, which keeps him above the 15% for viability, but LA has 51 delegates. That proportion will result in a 36-15 split for Clinton, which is -3 on the 538 tracker.

But delegates are also awarded by district, and the current split says [39-12](http://www.thegreenpapers.com/P16/LA-D) for Clinton, which is -6 on the 538 tracker and -27 on the delegate count.

End result is that Sanders doesn't improve on his tracker (net -2 on the 538 tracker), and the night ends up being a 9 delegate loss for him.

What a fucking scam

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

**EDIT:** 

Im getting alot of replies from people screaming at me for not reading the article, confirmation bias, its was from hrc to dnc and that therefore what i said is irrelevant,being a bernie bro, lying and a few other things apologies for the length, there was alot of replies and angles to reply on ill put it all below as replying to each would be impossible.


The title of the post is ""Bernie never stood a chance: Hacker leaks reveal DNC-Clinton coordination"" and i stand by my statement that through the whole primary campaign that this notion was branded a bernie bro conspiracy. Along with people saying the dnc was not impeding bernie just a bit of wasserman favor. I dont see anywhere there where i claim this article and the ""evidence"" in it proves those assertions, its almost like they didnt read it properly and just projected their own preconceptions of what i said.


And i stand by my statement about by after the primaries that social media and news outlets and the general public conversation switched on those issues, that were considered bernie bro crazy conspiracy theories, to covering them, theres calls for wassermans removal now, loads of articles about why she should be changed general acceptance that it was more than favor that she had her thumb on the scale. Then we have the co chair mr frank coming out and actually went on shows to counter sanders its in the public now, if he is willing to go around tv shows and actively  work against him so publicly near the end of the campaign are you guys telling me that there is 0 chance the dnc didnt do a few things to get in sanders way. We can say we agree to disagree on that maybe. Then we have this first leak from the new email hack and it shows they were talking, they were discussing the general and how hrc camp wanted them to proceed, nowhere am i claiming this is a smoking gun but that idea that they were talking like that was considered a crazy bernie conspiracy. I concede this mail only shows one way traffic at the moment but my point is the people that shouted the loudest about it being a conspiracy and there being no discussion like that at all are now the ones saying the loudest oh its irrelevant its only from hrc to dnc, it proves nothing, she was 60 up of course she was sending them this. 



So enough with the projecting of your confirmation biased perception filled replies based on what you think is between the lines, my agenda, my hidden narrative and how making this statement on this post linked to this article means im some how applauding the article, source, opinion given or its conclusions 



**TL;DR**

Read what i said and the point i was making not what you project you think im saying, did or didnt do, dont know, feel or think, especially when most of those type of replies accused me of doing it in their final paragraph

There is a stereotype that if you're only strong enough, you'll be able to handle coming back, to handle the PTSD without treatment and that seeking treatment is weak.  His comment plays directly into this idea that if you're strong enough, you'll handle it yourself and that if you can't, you're weak.

- registration problems/system problems
- reduced voting stations (~~200~~ 400-60)
- venues that were very small and/or had very little parking
- voting stations that were located such that certain areas were forced to drive and couldn't vote without a car
- not enough provisional ballots
- limited to no effort to communicate changes/information to voters
- no efforts whatsover to communicate to voters until 13 days before the election
- clear logic as to how this can affect the vote on a macro level (heavier weighting of early ballots in relation to disenfranchisement of indepedants, minorities, and students)
- video documented evidence of the problems posted online

Edit: wow, I'm astounded by the amount of denial coming from Trump supporters. I can't reply individually so I'm putting my response here. These replies seem to come in two variations.

1.  Where is the proof?

Realize that these agencies are charged with protecting U.S. interests.  If revealing proof will compromise their ability to detect and defer future threats they're not going to do it.  Also understand that levying charges against a foreign government, especially one as powerful as Russia, is serious business and wouldn't be undertaken lightly.  So unless you have the requisite security clearance and need-to-know I doubt you will ever see proof with your own eyes.  In the meantime there is plenty of circumstantial evidence that should certainly have you begging for an investigation, such as Trump himself inviting the Russians to hack his opponents, his blanket dismissal of CIA intelligence, the fact that his SOS appointment has close ties to Putin, that he lied about meeting Putin, the list goes on. Now that Obama has ordered an investigation we may finally have some answers.

2. Bbbbbbbut emails!

Are you seriously equating the content of the DNC emails with inference with our presidential election by a foreign government? These are not two equal wrongs that cancel out.  

Edit 2: I wonder how many of you asking for proof wouldn't be the first to cancel a trip because the CIA said they had evidence someone was planning to bomb your flight.  

Edit 3:  Please stop trying to act as if this article is the sole report on this.  There have been plenty of others:

It's an utter disgrace that people had to stand in line for hours, for many of them to learn that their votes likely wouldn't be counted anyway. It's sickening that Helen Purcell wants to blame voters for ""getting in line"". The whole thing was a complete fiasco, and there's plenty to discuss there without turning this into a big partisan jerk-off. But unfortunately, a lot of reactions here seem to suggest that way too many people - at least as represented on this sub - don't *actually* care about fair elections, so long as their own preferred candidate is likely unaffected.

In 2012 Russia wasn't doing much and Putin was laying relatively low.  In the time since, Putin: sock-puppeted unrest in Crimea and grabbed the region from Ukraine; sock-puppeted a civil war in Ukraine which is currently very much smoldering and will likely become quite active once Trump takes office; actively opposed US interests in Syria and provided arms and active military aid; and has caused Russia's military to become extremely aggressive towards deployed US assets and Eastern and Northern European nations.

One of the most loathsome people to ever fucking live on this planet, Ted Cruz, backstabbed and fucked over every person he came in contact with for the past four years, forced his party into a bunch of no-win scenarios that made them look stupid and clueless, and generally called out everyone in his entire party as a bunch of commiesymp Islamolibs who want to dress up as a gay-married woman and fuck a child in a public bathroom. He did all of these things knowingly, burning every bridge he's ever crossed, mauling every hand that's ever fed him, all in service of one dream: He would become the Republican nominee in 2016 and win the Presidency and then the trail of blood and nightmares he left behind wouldn't matter because fuck you I'm POTUS that's why. 

He sacrificed everything to this goal, and he's going to lose to the political equivalent of the Fukushima meltdown. His strategy would (probably) have worked! It's pretty clear that the JEB! never stood a chance regardless of how much money he raised because he's a fucking walking Ambien who conservatives thoroughly despise, Scott Walker couldn't even figure out how to hire someone who understood things like ""a budget,"" Ben Carson looks like an attractive candidate up until he has to speak in anything other than meaningless fortune-cookie platitudes, etc. All that work, all that planning, all that treachery, all that time.

ALL FOR FUCKING NOTHING AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA. 

He's been reaching for this brass ring his entire life, leaning farther and farther out from his carousel horse. What would he lose first, his balance, or his nerve? But he never flinched, leaning out further and further with each turn of the carousel, and then just before, just before his fingertip brushed it a tiny orange hand came out of nowhere and took that bitch right away from him, right in front of him, and there was never anything he could do to stop it. Now all that's left is the fall.

There aren't words in any language to describe the joy it brings me to see such a heinous, hateful motherfucker destroyed in such a gut-wrenching, miserable way. Tonight was the beginning of Ted Cruz's descent to a talk radio host saying things like, ""Well, when *I* was in the United States Senate, let me tell you...""

When she left the State Department she effectively became a private citizen. The server wasn't discovered until sometime later. 
Therefore, as a private citizen she had thousands of classified materials in her possession, as did her aides. As a private citizen she chose to delete 30k emails unilaterally. 

If there were any protections of being Secretary of State, wouldn't those be null once she became a citizen? If they don't charge her, aren't they setting a precedent that even if you leave office with thousands of classified documents (marked or not) in your possession, you cannot be charged? Or at minimum they have to prove intent that you planned to leak them. You could just throw your hands up and say ""Whoops, my bad. Good thing you have to prove that I had bad intentions with all of this classified material in my possession."" And even so, if the materials were leaked, the DOJ would have to prove that it was your intent they be leaked even if you didn't do it? It just seems to setup such a bad example for everyone else in government.

**EDIT** Essentially, she is claiming that she was permitted to have a private server as Secretary of State - this is very much debated. But is there any argument that she wouldn't be permitted to have a server full of classified material as a **private citizen?** Even if she continued to have security clearance, that would only allow her clearance to *view* materials in an authorized location not *store* classified material on a private homebrew server?"

He said that the FBI found evidence of potential violations of statutes. Then he said that because there have been no prosecutions in the past without intent, that no charges are appropriate. Since when is the lack of a precedent the same as a precedent? The statute in question clearly has a clause for gross negligence, and Comey himself said that Clinton was extremely careless, so why does it matter if no one has been indicted for gross negligence before? If Congress gets a new law passed, can the FBI just say that since no one has ever been prosecuted for this law before, that no charges are appropriate? And the Attorney General can just continue to say that she will ""expect to accept"" the FBI's recommendation? The Executive Branch should not be interpreting the law. They found evidence of potential gross negligence. Due process should occur. The evidence should be presented in a court of law.

Furthermore, after her inappropriate encounter with Bill Clinton during an ongoing investigation into his spouse, Attorney General Loretta Lynch must *actually* recuse herself, by assigning a special prosecutor who will determine whether or not the case should move forward. The FBI does not have the authority to determine prosecution, only to make a recommendation, and Lynch accepting their recommendation is not akin to recusing herself."

[Birtherism invented by Clinton supporters:](http://www.politico.com/story/2011/04/birtherism-where-it-all-began-053563)

&gt; That theory first emerged in the spring of 2008, as Clinton supporters circulated an anonymous email questioning Obama’s citizenship.

&gt; “Barack Obama’s mother was living in Kenya with his Arab-African father late in her pregnancy. She was not allowed to travel by plane then, so Barack Obama was born there and his mother then took him to Hawaii to register his birth”

[Hillary's Hypocrisy: Clinging to Obama After Her Racist Dog Whistles in 2008:](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/geoffrey-dunn/hillarys-hypocrisy-clinging-to-obama-after-her-racist-dog-whistles-in-2008_b_9011244.html)

&gt; In New Hampshire, Clinton's co-chair, Billy Shaheen, accused Obama of being a drug dealer; then there was the photograph of Sen. Barack Obama in Somali garb leaked to the press by Clinton's staff.

&gt; In the aftermath of the South Carolina primary, former President Bill Clinton compared Obama's victory to those of Jesse Jackson in 1984 and 1988. His message was clear: Obama was a marginal, black candidate.

&gt; Then came the disgraceful remarks of Geraldine Ferraro, who could not, and would not, shut her mouth. ""If Obama was a white man,"" she charged, ""he would not be in this position.""

&gt; ABC's George Stephanopoulos -- who worked as Bill Clinton's press secretary and lied through his teeth on Clinton's behalf (where's the journalistic ""objectivity"" here?) -- brought up Obama's relationship to former '60s radical Bill Ayers.

&gt; Amidst so much fury signifying nothing, Hillary Clinton finally did her own bidding. Racism is as racism does. She boldly linked Obama with Reverend Jeremiah Wright, and Wright with Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan. That linkage was patently racist at its core -- yet, once again, no one in the mainstream media so much as blinked. In so doing, Clinton was echoing the views of Fox News' resident racist Sean Hannity. Talk about shameful.

Let us not forget these,

[Bill Clinton’s attacks hurt Hillary as much as they did Obama. The Times denounced Clinton’s fairy-tale comment as a “bizarre and rambling attack” and as exemplifying a campaign that was “perilously close to injecting racial tension” into the conversation. At a press conference in South Carolina the morning after Obama won the state, Bill Clinton seemed to dismiss the victory as a fluke of local demography. “Jesse Jackson won South Carolina in ’84 and ’88,” he said. “Jackson ran a good campaign. And Obama ran a good campaign here.” Tim Russert told me that, according to his sources, Bill Clinton, in an effort to secure an endorsement for Hillary from Ted Kennedy, said to Kennedy, “A few years ago, this guy would have been carrying our bags.” Clinton’s role in the campaign rattled Obama. He told ABC News in an interview that Clinton “has taken his advocacy on behalf of his wife to a level that I think is pretty troubling.”](http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2012/09/10/lets-be-friends)

Millennials got a taste of socialism during the 2007-2008 financial meltdown: privatized gains, *socialized losses*.  The [Bailout](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_Economic_Stabilization_Act_of_2008) taught Millennials then and there that those in the position of absolute wealth and power are above the law and that the government would bail them out with golden parachutes while forcing the bottom 99% to fund their bailout with tax-payer money.  So while Wall Street executive got bonuses and raises for wrecking the economy, the common people got lay offs and recently-graduated students started their lives with 5 to 6 figures of student loan debt and no job prospects in what was the *worst recession since the Great Depression*.  Want that entry-level job?  Got to have 3-4 years experience.  Then Millennials get told, hey no job is beneath you - work at a burger joint (for minimum wage).  Except those minimum wage jobs that were supposedly for high school students are worked by those in their 40's and 50's - those who lost their jobs in the meltdown along with their retirement savings.  Millennials get told they're lazy, they're entitled, they made the stupid mistake of taking on student loan debt to fund their college education.  Well, sorry for wanting what Baby Boomers wanted.  Guess *they* forgot who is funding *their* Social Security.  That's right, us - Millennials.

In addition to the unsustainable economic effects of such a move, the issue is this: national defense IS a reality of modern civilization, and the critics of military spending haven't shown a very good alternative plan that actually works for spending.

For instance, people talk about cutting spending in comparison to China or Russia. Surely, if the US spends more than the next 8 nations combined, that's too much right?

**Comparing raw spending ignores differences in cost of living**

For one, 25% of the annual DOD budget is on payroll. Take a look at [Table 5.1](https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/search/pagedetails.action?granuleId=BUDGET-2015-TAB-5-1&packageId=BUDGET-2015-TAB&fromBrowse=true) from the government GPO publishing the annual budget for historical numbers.

Better yet, look at the White House's 2017 request: https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/budget/fy2017/assets/28_1.pdf

Again, 25% of the budget is on pay alone.

When we include benefits (like health care) - which includes operating and maintaining the system - it rises up to [46-49% of the total budget](http://i.imgur.com/4AsgidU.png), which again isn't insignificant.

Compare this to China - which pays its soldiers a tenth of what the US pays. So sure, if the US cuts its pay and benefits to Chinese levels, we'd cut our spending in half - but that's neither desirable nor realistic.

**Spending doesn't indicate relative power**

Military spending isn't on an open market. The US doesn't buy foreign equipment except from close allies like Germany or Belgium. Likewise, Russia can't buy US equipment. Thus, the US is spending primarily on first world developed goods at first world prices and first world wages for its equipment.

But does spending 3x as much on a fighter jet mean your fighter jet is 3x better? After all, a brand new F-15E Strike Eagle is ~$100 million now (per their latest sale to Saudi Arabia) while the Russian equivalent, a Su-34 is around $40 million. Is the Strike Eagle 2-3x as powerful?

Again, that's why comparing spending and saying the US spends too much ignores that US spending is based on relative power with rival nations, not rival spending.

**Military size is driven by the National Security Strategy**

The US National Security Strategy is published by the President every few years, typically at the beginning of each new administration, which outlines the foreign policy (including military) goals. This document outlines the overarching plan the President has for both the State and Defense departments. The 2015 revision by President Obama is located here:

https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/docs/2015_national_security_strategy.pdf

What kind of impact does this document have? Well, during the Cold War, the National Security Strategy was centered on: ""win two major wars at the same time."" This was believed to mean the Soviet Union in Europe, and China/North Korea in the Pacific. 

When the Cold War ended, President Clinton revised this figure to ""win-hold-win."" That is, win one major war while holding the line in another war, then winning that one when the first war concludes. This is similar in scale to the US ""Germany first"" strategy in place on the eve of WW2.

Result? During the Clinton administration, the US armed forces slimmed down from over 3 million personnel (active + reserve) to around 2.25 million. The US carrier fleet went from no fewer than 15 carriers at any time during the Cold War to 11. As you can see, that ratio of cuts went all over the military, and it was reflected in spending. In 1990, defense spending was 5.5% of the GDP. Today, its under 3.5%.

The 2009 revision, under President Obama, called for the ""Pivot to the Pacific"" which is believed to be directed at China. As a result, the US Navy moved its fleet from 60% in the Atlantic to 60% in the Pacific. High tech weapons were prioritized again (instead of low tech weapons for insurgents). The 2015 revision posted above adds Russia back in as a threat in Europe, which has only pushed the US military to focus more on conventional foes again. Long story short: the US military's base budget has actually *increased* under President Obama, as the focus is now on high tech foes rather than the low tech foes of Iraq or Afghanistan.

**The breakdown of US military spending often gets misconstrued**

There is a LOT of misinformation out there about the DOD budget, despite most of it is public info available on the Internet:

http://comptroller.defense.gov/Portals/45/Documents/defbudget/fy2017/FY2017_Budget_Request_Overview_Book.pdf

For instance, people think war funds are a huge part of the budget. At 58 billion, war funds (Overseas Contingency Operations, or OCO) was only 10% of the total budget request last year.

Acquisitions is 18-19%. In fact, maintenance and personnel account for the biggest areas of costs. So while it's easy to talk about stopping the purchase of new planes, we forget that we spend more maintaining existing aging aircraft. How old are we talking about? The average age of the Air Force plane is 27 years old. The last A-10 was built in *1984*. The last B-52 was built in *1962*. 

R&D meanwhile is 13-14% of the DOD budget, making it the largest research fund in the US and ranges from physics to space to medicine to energy. They are also the largest grantor of funds for everything from university grad students to national research labs.

Spending under the defense budget is also often in areas that ditectly impact civilians. The US military and defense-related agencies account for over [two-thirds](http://i.imgur.com/HXln8aB.jpg) of the country's space budget. This includes the US military being in charge of monitoring all space debris (which helps NASA immensely), maintaining and launching GPS satellites (something everyone gets free), buying weather satellites (which NOAA then administers), and even printing out aeronautical navigation charts and instrument approach plates for the safe landing of aircraft in bad weather. Take a look at this [civilian approach plate](http://i.imgur.com/WPAqljG.png) - notice that it says FAA and Department of Defense on there.

And they are involved in state diplomacy too. Did you know that over 100 nations have troops in the US for training a year? And that other nations station troops in the US too? For instance, tiny Singapore has multiple Air Force squadrons stationed in the US on Air Force bases. The Italian Navy, for example, also trains all of its pilots in the US Navy flight school program. That takes an immense amount of cooperation and trust between nations.

**Modern warfare makes waiting to spend impossible**

The whole idea of the ""military industrial complex"" (ironically, Eisenhower - who coined the term - actually SUPPORTED it, but the term has been co-opted by critics) exists because modern warfare makes sitting behind two oceans slowly building up a military an impossibility. Ever since WW2, it became clear that missiles, rockets, and long range bombers would make oceans pointless.

When ICBMs and bombers can take out your factories and training facilities, there is no ""wait for hostilities then start spending"" anymore. Day 1 operations are the focus of modern militaries around the world - if you can't hold back an enemy air offensive early, and your defenses are degraded, you have no ability to resist any further. Your air and missile defenses will be whittled down, your harbors blockaded, bases bombed, etc.

*That* is why peacetime military spending exists all around the world, and why most modern militaries maintain large active forces relative to their reserves in contrast to the past when one could simply conscript millions to be thrown into the grinder a year later.

**Geopolitics and geography are a significant driver of why we spend money**

The US currently has mutual defense treaties with: NATO countries, Japan, South Korea, the Philippines, and Australia. Most everyone agrees that maintaining such close relations with those countries is great for the US - but that doesn't come cheap, of course. 

A mutual defense treaty with NATO isn't nullified if China went to war with Japan - as a result, even if the US went to complete war with China, it would still maintain reserve forces capable of deterring aggression in Europe against say Russia (to achieve our National Security Strategy, as mentioned above).

In addition, world geography plays a significant role in all of this. Our defense treaties are all with nations on the opposite side of the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans. Those are huge distances to cover - a big reason why the US has as many forward bases overseas as it does. It's also a big reason why the US has many strategic airlift transports as it does (~290 - the UK and France combined have 7), aerial refueling tankers (~500 - the UK and France combined have < 20), and other logistical equipment. (Logistical equipment actually makes up the bulk of military equipment in the US). It's also why the US maintains a two ocean navy, in contrast to say the UK, which has largely become focused only on the Atlantic.

As you can see, without a decrease in our commitments, our budget cuts have a very very definite floor. Cutting it to save money for the sake of saving money doesn't lead to positive results without a corresponding decrease in what we want to do in the world, lest we continue to overstretch our forces, increase stress on service members, increase our wear and tear on equipment (which ends up needing to be replaced earlier, which means more money is spent in the long run), and kill retention, which is a major part of why our military is as capable as it is.

Edit: thanks for the gold!"

Then when polling showed Hillary losing in New Hampshire, she changed her tune and started actively calling for a debate in NH because it would primarily benefit her. She didn't care about more debates; she just wanted her opportunity to sway voters in NH and nothing else. This CA debate was a part of a bargain that included that NH debate, and now Hillary is going to go back on her word because it's no longer of use to her. And Hillary supporters wonder why almost nobody trusts her. And she does this type of thing all the time, like privately lobbying for trade deals that she publicly opposed.

*Beginning of primary season*

""Man, I love Bernie Sanders as a candidate. So inspiring, can't believe he's running for POTUS!""

""You're going to vote for Hillary in November, though, right?""

""Well, um, I'm a democrat not a Republican. Anyway, look at all these new people to the party, look at all these younger voters. This gives me a lot of hope. How great.""

""Where have they all *been* during the previous elections, though? Why don't they already know Robert's Rules of order at our meetings? They don't know how we already do things.""

""Well, yeah. That's fair on one point, I guess. You've been here longer. They're new to the process or young first time voters. They're excited about Bernie Sanders.""

""They'll vote for Hillary in November, right?""

""Um, I don't know for sure. Many of them are strongly tied to the Climate Action movement, democracy spring, occupy. Some of the older ones were formerly Independents. So, I can't say either way. I've no idea. You'd have to ask them""

""Bernie isn't a ""real"" democrat.""

""But he's energizing the party and bringing millions of people into it and has voted pretty much always with the democrats for decades!""

""Unless all of these new people at the meetings are going to vouch that they'll vote for Hillary in November, they aren't real democrats either.""

""Wait, hold on. That's not true. That's only a fraction of his support. He's very popular amongst many long time registered democrats. We need to welcome them as democrats. There is no litmus test for being a Democrat.""

""Why won't you just say that you'll vote for Hillary in November?""

""Gee, I dunno. I felt like the primary season was for us all to work for the candidate we prefer. What is it with the assumption that Hillary will beat him and be our choice for November? Can we at least have the primary?""

""Bernie needs to drop out. He's hurting Hillary.""

""But the primary is barely half over. Hillary ran against Obama to the very end. He's gaining momentum, people love him, and he's expected to do the best at the end of the campaign! Why is it a different standard for Bernie? No way he should drop out.""

""Obama was a real democrat. Why do you hate Hillary?""

""For crying out loud, nobody is saying that. What they're tired of is her campaign focus on telling the other candidate to drop out of the primary without really running.""

""This is really about hatred of Hillary. He needs to drop out for the good of the country because Trump.""

""Ok, but it isn't. It's about much love and being inspired by Bernie Sanders. We want him to win the nomination.""

""Ok, but you have to vote for Hillary in November.""

*Bernie Democrats have now learned to count to ten when it's demanded that they pledge to vote for Hillary*

Chapter Two

Bernie voters: ""We are feeling over and over again that we are having to fight obstacles and unfairness from our own party.""

""Stop being paranoid. Hillary's going to be the nominee in November. Haters gonna hate.""

""Yeah, that's not what we are saying though. We are your fellow Democrats and we are telling you something is very wrong all across the country.""

""Bernie needs to drop out. I'm sorry you hate Hillary so much that you're being sore losers.""

*Wikileaks are dropped, DNC is exposed*

Vindication and anger from Bernie voters.

Takes days for anyone from Democratic Party speaking on the matter to even have the grace to apologize to Senator Sanders. Or to their FELLOW Democrats.

Crickets from the HRC supporting Democrats. Crickets. Zero expression of disgust, surprise, dismay, concern or solidarity. Most Bernie Democrats heard none of their HRC Democrat friends call for the DNC to clean up their act and/or apologize to their fellow democrats.

Bernie Dems: ""Someone needs to be fired over this. It's unethical. They actively worked against one of their own candidates. Just like we have been trying to tell you for a year!""

""Fine. Debbie will resign. But she will still be given a speaking slot. And open the convention. Also, she will resign without mentioning the scandal. Without apology.

""Are you freaking kidding me right now?""

""Also, Hillary has immediately hired Debbie for a prestigious and powerful position, thus condoning her behavior.""

""Yeah, well the screw Hillary and screw the DNC.""

""Grow up.""

""Your party is corrupt. You need to clean house. It's egregious. It's shameful. So is your silence about the conduct of the DNC.""

""We don't have time for this. Also. You have to vote for Hillary in November.""

""F--- you. And the horse you rode in on.""

>As Surgeon General, Dr. Elders was also a vocal proponent of comprehensive sex education and famously suggested schools should teach about masturbation – another position which put her at odds with the White House. “Anytime we don’t give the full story, that’s a problem,” she told Marijuana Politics, “I thought that our children should have a complete sexual education.”

Not only does the story appear to be completely fabricated, but it was also quickly picked up and turned into fake news, as explained in this tweetstorm from [Jesse Singal](https://twitter.com/jessesingal/status/799455529756139521) (of New York Magazine). Reuters even reported it, basically uncritically, burying the lede that [Trump had just made the whole thing up](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CxhCNhmXgAE2N9T.jpg:large). 

-------

[***EDIT***] 

Based on some of the comments of people trying to rationalize Trump's false claim, key details seem to be getting lost--especially the fact that **the Louisville, KY plant and its jobs were never moving to Mexico**. Ford had intended to *move* MKC production so that it could *expand* its current production of the Escape at the Louisville plant using the extra capacity, with no net job losses. So the idea that Trump somehow stopped the Louisville *plant* from leaving Kentucky or saved jobs is absurd.

The NYT's reporting on this story helps to clarify.

[Donald Trump Takes Credit for Helping to Save a Ford Plant That Wasn’t Closing]
(http://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/18/us/politics/donald-trump-takes-credit-for-helping-to-save-a-ford-plant-that-wasnt-closing.html):

>Ford makes the Lincoln MKC, a sport utility vehicle, at a factory in Louisville. Last week, Ford said it planned to move production of the vehicle elsewhere. On Thursday night, after Mr. Trump’s Twitter messages, the company said that Mexico had been the intended destination and that it would now keep MKC production in Kentucky.

>**But Ford had not planned to close the Louisville factory.** Instead, it had **planned to expand production of another vehicle made in Louisville, the Ford Escape.** And the change had **not been expected to result in any job losses.**

>**“Whatever happens in Louisville, it will not lose employment,”** Jimmy Settles, a union official, told The Detroit Free Press. ***“They cannot make enough Escapes.”***

[TL:DR] Trump gets no credit for this. If anyone does, it should probably be the United Auto Workers for negotiating a contract that apparently restricts Ford's ability to move factories until 2019."

I am not an election law lawyer but I am an attorney who frequently appears in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York.  Last year, I tried a case to verdict in front of [Judge  Joanna Seybert](https://www.nyed.uscourts.gov/content/judge-joanna-seybert), the District Court Judge who ruled on the Temporary Restraining Order (""TRO"") plaintiffs in *Campanello v. New York State Board of Elections* (that's the proper name of the lawsuit OP is describing) sought.

As you can see from the linked order by Judge Seybert, the marking is ""TRO application denied.""  That means none of the initial relief sought by the plaintiffs was granted. That means the situation continues as if the lawsuit was never filed.

http://ia601508.us.archive.org/6/items/gov.uscourts.nyed.384188/gov.uscourts.nyed.384188.7.0.pdf

New York always allowed a person claiming to have been the subject of a clerical error removing them from the voting rolls or changing their party without their consent to file a provisional ballot with an affidavit.  *See* [New York Election Law § 8-302(e)(ii)](http://codes.findlaw.com/ny/election-law/eln-sect-8-302.html#sthash.g9C5WBBR.dpuf):

>(e) Whenever a voter presents himself or herself and offers to cast a ballot, and he or she claims to live in the election district in which he or she seeks to vote but no registration poll record can be found for him or her in the poll ledger or his or her name does not appear on the computer generated registration list or his or her signature does not appear next to his or her name on such computer generated registration list or his or her registration poll record or the computer generated registration list does not show him or her to be enrolled in the party in which he or she claims to be enrolled, a poll clerk or election inspector shall consult a map, street finder or other description of all of the polling places and election districts within the political subdivision in which said election district is located and if necessary, contact the board of elections to obtain the relevant information and advise the voter of the correct polling place and election district for the residence address provided by the voter to such poll clerk or election inspector.  Thereafter, such voter shall be permitted to vote in said election district only as hereinafter provided:

***

>(ii) He or she may swear to and subscribe an affidavit stating that he or she has duly registered to vote, the address in such election district from which he or she registered, that he or she remains a duly qualified voter in such election district, that his or her registration poll record appears to be lost or misplaced or that his or her name and/or his or her signature was omitted from the computer generated registration list or that he or she has moved within the county or city since he or she last registered, the address from which he or she was previously registered and the address at which he or she currently resides, and at a primary election, the party in which he or she is enrolled.  The inspectors of election shall offer such an affidavit to each such voter whose residence address is in such election district.  Each such affidavit shall be in a form prescribed by the state board of elections, shall be printed on an envelope of the size and quality used for an absentee ballot envelope, and shall contain an acknowledgment that the affiant understands that any false statement made therein is perjury punishable according to law.  Such form prescribed by the state board of elections shall request information required to register such voter should the county board determine that such voter is not registered and shall constitute an application to register to vote.  The voter's name and the entries required shall then be entered without delay and without further inquiry in the fourth section of the challenge report or in the place provided at the end of the computer generated registration list, with the notation that the voter has executed the affidavit hereinabove prescribed, or, if such person's name appears on the computer generated registration list, the board of elections may provide a place to make such entry next to his or her name on such list.  The voter shall then, without further inquiry, be permitted to vote an affidavit ballot provided for by this chapter.  Such ballot shall thereupon be placed in the envelope containing his or her affidavit, and the envelope sealed and returned to the board of elections in the manner provided by this chapter for protested official ballots, including a statement of the number of such ballots. 

  That was the law on Monday before the lawsuit was filed and it is still the law on Tuesday afternoon after the plaintiffs were completely shut out.

Yes, the lawsuit continues, but that was not the question Judge Seybert was considering at the hearing today and the case was sent back to a different District Court Judge ([Sandra J. Feuerstein](https://www.nyed.uscourts.gov/content/judge-sandra-j-feuerstein)) where the case will proceed on a regular track and, following the filing of an amended complaint, the Boards of Elections of every New York county will move to dismiss.

This was not a ""win"" for Bernie Sanders supporters by any definition of the word and I don't know which is worse, the misleading headline or the redditors so willing to swallow that misleading headline as the truth.

**Edit**:  Thanks for the gold kind stranger.  Permit me to take this opportunity to apologize for my last sentence about ""redditors so willing to swallow misleading headlines.""  One commentor called me a ""dismissive jerk"" for that and, having thought better of it, I plead guilty as charged.

https://www.muckrock.com/foi/new-bedford-595/mayor-jon-mitchells-super-tuesday-plans-24331/

Here's what the assistant chief of staff to Mayor Mitchell, who coordinated with Clinton on the rallies, had to say about violating laws related to campaigning too close to polling places:
> “Essentially Clinton was forced to speak that close to the entrance because the MEDIA parked themselves there before 9 a.m. The City did not set that up as a staging area,” Arsenault wrote to Treadup Pio in a separate email. “As for breaking the law: I don’t see what others have quoted as the law online. AND—isn’t jay-walking a law? These people that are so concerned about this law should review every law.”

Edit: For those who don't feel like muddling through the full emails, [this article](http://www.bostonmagazine.com/news/blog/2016/03/30/bill-clinton-new-bedford-emails/) contains a great summary of the emails related to these campaign rallies produced in response to Muckrock's FOIA request.

For those folks claiming that no one was blocked or prevented from voting, here is the text of an email from Buttonwood Park Division Director Michelle Tassinari to Shannon Shreve, counsel for the city of New Bedford, regarding Bill Clinton's campaigning at polling locations:
> Can you call me? We are getting many calls about the area around the polling places being shut down, per order of the Mayor. This is a BIG problem.

Edit 2: I incorrectly attributed the first quote to Clinton's staff, when it was actually a member of Mayor Mitchell's staff. Mayor Mitchell worked with Clinton to set up the rallies and [introduced him in New Bedford](http://www.southcoasttoday.com/article/20160305/NEWS/160309630).

> In New Bedford, Mitchell acted as Clinton’s warm-up act, telling the party loyalists that Bill was the “husband of a soon-to-be-great president.” Then the smoothest politician of the second-half of the 20th century shrugged his shoulders and said he also wanted a shout-out for his wife’s opponents. That, of course, was just before he cooed “Let’s do our part to get her over the hump now.”"

You are in a popular barber shop in Berlin. 6 other men and 3 women, friends or wives of the men, are in the barber shop with you. The radio is playing wonderful music by Wilhelm Bach.  Everybody is enjoying the music.      
    
A radio announcer interrupts the music program and says he has an important announcement for all Germans and Germany.    
    
Several nice German people crowd around the radio with you to hear the important announcement.    
    
Millions of Germans across Germany are crowding around their radios, too.  
    
The radio announcer says, in German, ""Ladies and Gentlemen, today the National Socialist German Worker's Party has just released a statement that it has appointed Adolf Hitler as the new Chancellor of Germany.""  
    
Everybody in the barber shop smiles. Everybody likes the news. They are all thinking the same thing, ""Hitler. A great man. Our Chancellor. He will make Germany great again.""     
    
A man standing next to you, Heinz, asks you, ""What kind of Chancellor do you think Hitler will be?  
    
You look straight into Heinz's eyes and answer, ""6 years from now he will start World War Two. The war will last 6 years. The war will kill more than 70 million people around the world. Beginning today, during the next 12 years, Hitler will order the execution of more than 11 million Jews and other minorities in Germany, Poland, and other countries that border Germany. Hitler's Nazi Party will murder most of those 11 million victims in concentration camps.""  
    
Heinz looks at you like you are crazy and says, ""You are out of your mind. Hitler is a great man. We all love him. He will be a great Chancellor. He will make the Fatherland great again. Get out of here. We don't want to ever see or hear you again. Don't ever come back to this barber shop!""  
    
You walk out of the barber shop and return to your life in the year 2016. The date is November 25, seventeen days after the 2016 Presidential Election. You sit down in your comfortable chair in your home and think about what the great American writer Mark Twain once said:

Here is a thought experiment that I hope every one of you who is still undecided or unsure if you want to vote for Clinton will consider - don't think about what happens if he loses this election and refuses to concede, that will be problematic, but it won't destroy America, it will probably hurt some people, but we will survive.

Consider what will happen if he *wins*. What does the 2020 election look like? What if he loses his 2020 reelection and claims *that* result was rigged. What if he behaves like this once he is Commander-in-Chief of our armed forces, when the DOJ is staffed with his appointees, when he has a Supreme Court with 3 of his justices, and friendly appointees at the district and appellate level. Look at how the GOP (who will control the governors' mansions of most states) is standing up to him now? They are not at all.

(Of course, by using the term evolution, one must assume that she will not “devolve” on certain positions once elected.) Indeed, one cannot discuss the issues for very long without finding major changes in Clinton’s policy positions — some of which may be genuine, others that are undoubtedly motivated by political self-interest, and still others that may be both sincere and self-serving.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

>On gay marriage, for example, Clinton most likely supported it privately before 2013, even though she opposed it publicly. But only when it became sufficiently popular among the population did she suddenly become a leading advocate of marriage equality.

>Other talking points that she has changed her tune on, like the Trans-Pacific-Partnership — which some have called “NAFTA on steroids” — seem to be entirely political. Before coming out in opposition to the deal, she had vocally supported it dozens of times, even calling it the “gold standard” of trade deals. Only after Bernie Sanders had made it an important issue in the race did Clinton alter her position. Progressives have taken note of many other matters that Clinton the campaigner has changed position on, from fracking to immigration reform to free trade in general. (Clinton was an ardent supporter of the 2011 trade deal with Panama, which has recently come under the spotlight after the Panama Papers leak.)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

>Even the one issue where Clinton is genuinely more progressive than Sanders is tarnished by her chameleon-like maneuvering. By now, everyone knows that Clinton is to Sanders’ left on gun control — which does not mean that Sanders is regressive, as the Clinton campaign has frequently tried to portray him. The Senator has a D-minus rating from the NRA, and supports most gun control measures — including a ban on assault weapons. Last week, this issue became a source of heated discussion after Sanders gave an interview with the New York Daily News.

>In the interview, Sanders was asked whether victims of gun violence should be able to sue gun manufacturers for damages, as family members of the Sandy Hook massacre are currently trying to do. At first, Sanders simply replied no, but then expanded on his answer after appearing to realize that it would be twisted to paint him as an NRA-stooge by his opponent.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

>Sure enough, the Clinton campaign quickly used the Sandy Hook tragedy against him, Tweeting that he “prioritized gun manufacturers’ rights over the parents of the children killed at Sandy Hook.”

>Clinton went even further a few months earlier, when she implied that Sanders’ view on gun control was inherently racist, after the Senator — who comes from a rural state with many gun owners — said that gun control laws in an urban setting like New York City may not be suitable for a rural area where hunting and farming are widespread.

>“There are some who say that [gun violence] is an urban problem,” said Clinton, during a speech in Charleston, South Carolina, where the Charleston Church massacre had occured a few months earlier. “Sometimes what they mean by that is: it’s a black problem. But it’s not. It’s not black, it’s not urban. It’s a deep, profound challenge to who we are.”

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

>For a campaign trying to paint its opponent as a heartless dog-whistling lackey for the NRA, you would expect its own candidate to have a pretty consistent background on the issue. But of course, we’re talking about Hillary Clinton. During her 2008 campaign, Clinton’s tune on guns was quite different, especially after her then opponent Barack Obama opined that some Americans “cling to guns or religion.” Clinton called his comments “elitist” and “out of touch,” and even bragged about learning how to shoot a gun as a child. She also made an argument that was very similar to the allegedly racist argument that Sanders made in 2015:

>“What might work in New York City is certainly not going to work in Montana,” said Clinton. “So, for the federal government to be having any kind of, you know, blanket rules that they’re going to try to impose, I think doesn’t make sense.”

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

>***This kind of political opportunism — on an issue that Clinton seems to genuinely care about — is why her “evolution” on so many other topics is difficult for progressives to accept. Does this mean that none of her views can change with time, or that all of her opinions are politically motivated? Of course not. Beliefs change, especially when new evidence presents itself. But one has to be truly credulous not to be at least somewhat dubious about Clinton’s evolving views. Right now, she is adapting to the current political climate, and once the general election comes around, she will adapt again, and again, and again.***

For example, when Trump launched into an inexplicable attack on the parents of a Muslim-American soldier who died in combat, the Kremlin assumed the Republican nominee was showing himself psychologically unfit to be president and would be forced by his party to withdraw from the race. As a result, Moscow put its hacking campaign temporarily on hold, ending the distribution of documents until Trump stabilized, both personally and in the polls, according to reports.

>...attackers would probe election offices in advance to find ways to break into computers. Closer to election, when it was clear from polling which states would have close margins, the attackers might spread malware into machines in some of these states, rigging machines to shift a few % of the vote to favor desired candidate. This malware would likely be designed to remain inactive during preelection tests, do its dirty business during election, then erase itself when polls close. A skilled attacker’s work might leave no visible signs though the country might be surprised when results in several close states were off from preelection polls.

I'll offer one thing further. Are guns designed to primarily kill people with malicious intent?

This hit me hard. I grew up in a trailer for a good part of my life with a single mother who worked her ass off to give me clothes and food. My dad left when I was a toddler, and she had a couple committed relationships since, but the screaming was something that still haunts me.

Now I have two kids, and awesome job, six figure household income, and life is good. But I will gladly pay more taxes knowing that my money will help at least one kid not have to hear their parents screaming about what bill they have to let slide that month. I will gladly pay more taxes so one more kid doesn't grow up dreading the mail, or a phone call. This is what I believe in.

EDIT: Just a quick note or two since this is like my most upvoted comment ever. And I posted it when I fell asleep.

-The current government is a wasteful mishmash of inefficiency and red tape. Extra money from me right now would do little to help in the way that I feel is most helpful. The budget must be balanced, waste must be cut, and then more efficient social programs can be implemented. We keep building extra rooms onto our shitty treehouse and surprised when it doesn't keep the cold air out.

-Financial education from grade school is a must if any of Sanders programs are going to have the lasting effect they require. My wife taught me how to budget because he mother had the foresight to teach her. If I hadn't met my wife I would still have a very shitty life.

-I work with millionaires for a living. Trust me when I say that success is about 50% hard work and 50% knowing the right people. Voting for Sanders won't change that, but if it puts more people in the right place at the right time who want to work hard, fuck yeah. How many young Elon Musks or Bill Gates are starving in a ghetto somewhere, surrounded by gangs, drugs, etc. Anger is the easiest option at the bottom, not hope, and that is what America is truly starving for, the Hope and opportunity that made this country great. 

-The current system of campaign finance allows Billionaires to climb the ladder and pull it up behind them. That is why it's 1%, not 5% or 10%. This world needs more Billionaires and Millionaires, and a potential business master of our time is instead pouring water in his bottom shelf bowl of cereal before he goes to school late.

EDIT 2: People keep mentioning charity. I do contribute locally, however charity has two problems, corruption and clout. A charity has little oversight and can run major ad campaigns and pay big salaries while not getting much done for people (see Susan G Komen, Autism Speaks, etc.) Then you have groups like HRC and PP that have to play the game and endorse candidates that have flip flopped on their missions like crazy because it's the safe option. People can run FOIA requests on the government, not charities. Many are just the private sector trying to solve public problems.

Clout is another issue. The government has a farther reach and doesn't have to compete to get it's message across and mission across. Rights are inherent in the legislation and are enforceable in court. An efficient government program built from the ground up in a non-corrupt system could do wonders for many people. Many legitimate charities have to spend half of their income on getting the word out which leaves very little left over for actually helping people.

I'll add my two cents as a guy that has worked in Braddock PA, the town he's mayor of, for the last six years. 

For those that don't know, Braddock once boasted a population of over 20,000. After the steel industry shit the bed, Braddock's population started dwindling fast. The crack cocaine epidemic hit Braddock as hard as most towns as well. Even the hospital left (Mr. Fetterman was arrested in a protest trying to keep the hospital). The town now has just under 2,000 residents. That's 10% of it's former glory.

Mr. Fetterman has done so much to keep Braddock from complete collapse. My dad grew up in Braddock, just before the downturn. As a kid (and still today) we would pass through town via Braddock Ave (Braddock's main Street) and he'd point out empty lots and abandoned buildings and tell me how it used to be one of several movie theaters, or a butcher, or a convenience store.

While Braddock isn't back to its former glory, I can drive you down Braddock ave and point to an art gallery, a restaurant, a jewelry maker, a daycare, a flower shop, a brewery and several other businesses. 

Braddock has done a great job of attracting the artistic and the dedicated. Mr. Fetterman is selling Braddock as a town with a clean slate, ready for anyone with enough gumption to carve out a piece of a new town. I can't wait to see what he can do for the whole state. "

Huge disappointment from Obama, but not surprising. Let's get to know the woman he endorsed.

She opposes normalizing relations with Cuba, thinks Jewish intermarriage is ""a problem"", supports the drug war, supports TPP, wants to deregulate predatory lending, removed Obama's campaign finance rules, supports the patriot act and mass surveillance, opposes medical marijuana but offered to change her position if a major donor would withdraw criticism of her.

I think that her controversial support of Panama's free trade agreement will weaken that lead even further, especially if Bernie wisely chooses to bring up the subject during the debate.

They have primed everyone's mind for the coming takedown and if I was Hillary Rodham Clinton, I would be terrified right now.

Intelligence is very much a parallel world with its own culture and mission to keep the US safe from its threats. A key part of that mandate is ensuring operational security at all costs and is reinforced by the protocols everyone interacting with this community learns. These protocols are vital, because even the smallest of details - [such as who someone is having lunch with](https://np.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/4215z7/what_did_geraldo_draw_in_the_sand_that_got_him/cz7k6uv) - can give away the advantage. And make no mistake, all nations spy on each other. All nations are looking at the United States and waiting for a slip up to understand our strategy. It is a very paranoid game that these people play.

What HRC did is treason in the eyes of this world. She transmitted classified information in the clear. The repercussions of this are so far reaching and profound, it's likely that lives have already been lost. As I've said before, (I'm copying some information from that comment) this might sound like hyperbole, but it honestly isn't. **The security of operational information is only as secure as the *weakest* link.** Secretary Clinton created a weak link on purpose, which sophisticated hackers could and probably did use as an access point to gain access to more secure networks. If you think this is sci-fi, then well this is exactly how STUXNET was spread:

> Once the two elements were married, the entire package might then have been delivered to someone with access to Natanz (or to a related installation). **Wittingly or not, this Patient Zero began the infection process, perhaps by plugging a USB flash drive into a critical network.** The virus probably spread with the help of foreign contractors and engineers, whose computers were infected during visits to Iranian installations.
>
> https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2011/03/stuxnet-201104

For this very reason, all American intelligence networks (JWICS and SIPRnet) are separate from the internet. They are physically separate with an independent infrastructure spanning the globe at the cost of billions of dollars. Highly sensitive information like Special Access Programs exist within these networks with explicit ""air gaps"" that are created using SCIFs (Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility) where the nature of these secrets is psychologically reinforced by really burly men and tough women with guns who will shoot you if you act funny. The terminals themselves are isolated from the rest of the world electrically,  acoustically,  thermally, and  electromagnetically. (you're in a Faraday cage with a known power source and a white noise generator)

For even greater security, no one individual outside of certain key decision makers have broad ranging access. Information is compartmentalised according to the role and very few people see an entire file, let alone all of the intelligence stored within this system. This is a protocol reinforced at the cost of billions of dollars, because it contains the name of our spies, analysts, what our diplomats are up to, our strategies... The whole works. Hillary Clinton compromised the security of this system so thoroughly that Edward Snowden is a blessing in comparison.

She acted as a purposeful bridge between JWICS / SIPRNet and an unsecured channel. She purposefully jeopardised the security of every single man and woman involved within American clandestine operations across the world. There are people who might die because of this. It is that serious. In fact, we KNOW that her emails were compromised. Here's one of my favourite blogs on this matter:

> As for the ""security"" of Hillary's e-mails, that train left the station a long time ago.  **The infamous hacker Gucifer,** now cooling his heels in a Romanian jail, first disclosed existence of the back channel system when he hacked into the e-mail account of Sidney Blumenthal, the long-time aide and confidant to the former Secretary of State.  While rooting around in Mr. Blumenthal's e-mails, he **found a series of messages sent to Mrs. Clinton.  Many contained intelligence information, apparently gathered from Blumenthal's various contacts.**  In some instances, he cautioned, the summaries contained ""extremely sensitive"" information, drawn form sources close to various foreign groups and governments.  Details of the e-mails were published at The Smoking Gun, but the information did not include Mrs. Clinton's responses. 
>
> Obviously, if a lone hacker was able to uncover Mrs. Clinton's e-mail domain, it wouldn't be very hard for the intelligence services of Russia, China and other U.S. adversaries to access her messages as well.  And it raises legitimate questions about the type of information the former secretary of state was sending via unsecure e-mail. 
>
> http://formerspook.blogspot.com/2015/03/hillarys-e-mail-problem.html

If you read through the facts, then there is no other way to put this, she broke the law. She displayed gross negligence when she compromised the security of highly classified networks through her practices. When you handle this information you are taking on the responsibility of keeping this information safe at all costs - something that was explicitly mentioned in the document she signed at the start of her term. She purposefully violated this agreement, because she thought she was above this. This is unacceptable.

Again, the information she did this with isn't garden variety classified stuff like details of ports or ships. Her infractions involved Special Access Programs - these are the programs with live operational details and only a handful of people have broad access to them. This handful includes the Secretary of State and POTUS. They are that sensitive.

She will go to jail.

**Correction** A few eagle eyed people spotted a misstatement in how I've discussed NIPRnet. I apologise for that to clarify what I'm trying to say is that the sense that the network is separate i.e. NIPRnet is still a private network owned by the DoD, BUT unlike JWICS / SIPRnet it is connected to the outside one. I think talking about air gaps after that muddled it up a bit.

**Final Note.** I've removed NIPRnet entirely."

As someone who voted Sanders in the primary, if you cannot get behind Clinton as the Dem candidate, that is your business. But please, don't let a Clinton candidacy discourage you from voting in November, or anytime after. Downballot elections are important - US House and Senate seats are vital to shaping policy; state races are vital to shaping your state's economic and social policies (see NC, GA, KS, WI and others); and your local races are vital to your day to day life.

Educate yourself on those races and vote. If your POTUS vote is third party, hold-your-nose or not at all, fill out the rest of that ballot according to your interests.

I myself will be looking at polls in my state as the election grows nearer because Clinton is not my first or even second choice, but she may very well be my last choice out of necessity. 

And as others point out, your vote for third parties give them future access to the ballot and monies if the numbers are high enough. The system has been rigged; learn how to game that system for the future."
