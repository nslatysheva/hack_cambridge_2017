Clinton set up a personal email account and used it for work.

She may have violated department policies, but there\\\\u2019s no evidence she broke any laws.\\\\n\\\\n2. Clinton has said it was a mistake and apologized for it.\\\\n\\\\n3. There were concerns that her email server could have been vulnerable to hacking from a foreign power. But it does not appear to have been hacked.\\\\n\\\\n4. None of the work-related emails she sent and received were marked classified at the time. However, some 200 of them were retroactively classified. This is now the subject of a spat between the State Department and the intelligence community, which classifies many things that people elsewhere in the government think are absurd to classify.\\\\n\\\\n5. For Clinton to be charged with mishandling classified information, she would have had to knowingly passed such information to someone not authorized to have it \\\\u2014 like David Petraeus showing classified documents to his mistress \\\\u2014 or acted with such gross negligence that people without authorization were bound to see it. According to what we know, neither of those things happened.\\\\n\\\\n6. The FBI is investigating the matter, but has said that Clinton herself is not a target of that investigation, meaning that they don\\\\u2019t suspect that she committed any crime.\\\\n\\\\n7. That former aide, Bryan Pagliano, has been granted immunity by the Justice Department and is working with them as they complete their investigation, which will probably conclude this spring.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nEdit: This is from the article, I did not create it.\",\"235\":\"Because it\\'s bullshit?\",\"236\":\"*Desperation intensifies*\",\"237\":\"yes it did \\\\n\\\\n4D chess\",\"238\":\"With the primaries at an end and after a good beer, I feel that it\\'s time to better describe my political stance as of late, and to offer a retort to some of the prevailing reasoning behind (some of) your choices.\\\\n\\\\nGoing into this race about a year ago, I knew that any alternative to Hillary Clinton from the Democratic side was going to be a rather long shot. She certainly has had a lengthy career and the political acumen to go with it, and all else being equal, there would be no question as to who I would be voting for.\\\\n\\\\nHowever, all is not equal. I did not anticipate Donald Trump becoming the leader of the GOP and unloading his flavor of ambiguous yet vicious trolling that would make Nathan Poe (the originator of Poe\\'s Law) blush. His nationalistic rhetoric is taken from a playbook used about 75 years ago to justify unspeakable horrors. He clearly has no regard for the well-being of the American people or the image that we project abroad, and is more than willing to sell whatever principles and establishments we have left to enrich himself and the misguided upper crust who supports him.\\\\n\\\\nI also did not anticipate Bernie Sanders to gain such popularity, especially with my generation. Though I do not agree with all of his viewpoints, his honesty, tenacity, and general goodwill seemed to leave all other presidential candidates in the dust. He presented us with some hard truths about the direction this country has been heading in, and offered solutions that would have been implemented with enthusiasm if this were almost any European country instead of the United States.\\\\n\\\\nHe had my vote in the primary. He lost. One brand of reasoning dictates that I should vote for Hillary Clinton solely to prevent Trump from taking over, if for nothing else.\\\\n\\\\nI will not be doing so because she does not deserve my vote.\\\\n\\\\nSomeone who changes viewpoints on critical issues to suit public opinion with little intent of following through with legislation does not deserve my vote. Someone who takes money from major industries and wealthy donors for favors and future positions does not deserve my vote. Someone who lies to the people and to Congress on mishandling classified information, barely skating out of an indictment, instead of admitting it and rectifying the situation as quickly as possible, does not deserve my vote. Someone who hires curators to manufacture support and stifle oppositional discussion on social media does not deserve my vote. Someone who conspires with party leadership to subvert another candidate\\'s chances, then hires the conspirator into her own campaign after she is ousted, does not deserve my vote.\\\\n\\\\nLet me make it clear that I do this knowing that a Trump presidency would be disastrous. However, as a whole, Clinton\\'s actions are wholly and completely disqualifying for a purported leader of the free world. I have no trust that she is capable of setting aside her own ambitions and following the will of the people. Were it not for Bernie demonstrating that trustworthy politicians do in fact exist, I would have swallowed my pride in resignation that this is the way of politics. My mind is now made up otherwise.\\\\n\\\\nIf Hillary loses, do not blame it on people like me. Blame it on Hillary for having all tact, wherewithal, and integrity succumb to greed. I will likewise not blame you if you vote for her because that is your choice, as this is mine.

This is mostly a medical discussion argument, but I wanted to distill down the pure fundamentals of the argument, regardless of who the person is.  What follows is a purely objective discussion based on medical facts in the context of the video we have of HRC:\\\\n\\\\nFirst Parkinson\\'s is a disease affecting your motor\\\\/movement processes.  Look it up online to see complete explanations or videos.\\\\n\\\\n* \\\\\"Coughing spells\\\\\": Parkinson\\'s patients die from aspiration pneumonia because they lose movement coordination of their esophagus.  Think of having reflux all of the time and that hanging out around your airway.  I think it\\'s true that HRC has pneumonia but it\\'s probably aspiration pneumonia or infection related to aspiration pneumonia, not your everyday pneumonia.  That she was allowed to walk around later today hugging kids and that she didn\\'t look visibly sick supports this.  You could hang around people with aspiration inflammatory pneumonia without infecting them, you CAN\\'T hang around people.  People don\\'t rebound for infectious pneumonia in a few hours (more on this further down). \\\\n* \\\\\"Weakness\\\\\": I think this is autonomic dysfunction. This is where I differ from other people and I haven\\'t seen this brought up by others.  Parkinson\\'s also affects your ability to maintain normal blood pressure and can give you orthostatic hypotension (you stand up and can\\'t maintain blood pressure to your brain, which leads to confusion and essentially passing out).  I think today\\'s episode is our first support for this Parkinson\\'s autonomic dysfunction effect.  That she was able to rebound so quickly is also in support because orthostatic hypotension related to Parkinson\\'s is intermittent and can be rectified\\\\/treated.  Sometimes you can just run a high blood pressure to help with this but she\\'s on blood thinners and any doctor wouldn\\'t want to run her at a high blood pressure because of risk of hemorrhage into the brain; if she was on blood thinners then bleeding into the brain would be catastrophic.\\\\n* \\\\\"Seizures\\\\\": I think these are movement disorders. Plenty of people have chalked this up to seizures but she doesn\\'t really have the normal confusion after seizure, I think there is something less dramatic going on.  The types of movement abnormalities she\\'s demonstrated would be more in line with Parkinson\\'s which you\\'re not going to have residual deficits for.\\\\n* Chronicity: Treated Parkinson\\'s patients steadily decline and then start a rapid decline after years of treatments.  I think we are just starting on the rapid decline.  That she is having vehicle modifications and that her staff seem so coordinated in dealing with her episodes makes me think this is not a new thing.  This would support a more chronic disease process.  \\\\n* Avoiding public appearances: Treatment of Parkinson\\'s involves an ebb-and-flow of being functional and non-functional.  Using medication you can ramp yourself up for special events to make yourself functional but you can\\'t do this for a prolonged period of time successfully.\\\\n* Wikileaks October Surprise: A simple email to\\\\/from any friend, relative, or doctor that looks into Parkinson\\'s treatment; a medical record; anything that mentions Parkinson\\'s and she\\'s done.  It would take 1 email from her doctor to slip through the cracks and her presidential career would be over.  \\\\n\\\\ntl;dr I think HRC has Parkinson\\'s and what we saw today is just a gradually worsening manifestation of her disease (see autonomic dysfunction).\",\"260\":\"[David Shuster](https:\\\\/\\\\/twitter.com\\\\/DavidShuster\\\\/status\\\\/749378571962052612)\\\\n\\\\n> @TeddyDavisCNN @evanperez You mean \\\\\"sources in @HillaryClinton campaign.\\\\\"  Careful.

In 1992, Ross Perot was running for president and he had about 7% in pre-debate polls, and the commission wanted him out of the debate. But at the time, President George H. W. Bush was losing in the polls, and he thought he thought that Perot\\'s participation would help him. So his top negotiator sat down with the Clinton\\'s side and insisted that Perot participate. \\\\n\\\\nClinton eventually agreed because he didn\\'t want to be seen as excluding a popular 3rd party candidate, but the commission actually fought back. At first, they wanted to limit his participation to just a single debate, but because both Clinton and Bush thought he would serve their interests, he was allowed to join.\\\\n\\\\nPerot climbed in the polls from 7% to 19%, he was widely considered to have won 2 of 3 of the debates, and he obtained millions of dollars in federal funding, and he became the most successful 3rd party candidate since Teddy Roosevelt. \\\\n\\\\nFast forward four years to 1996. 76% of the public wanted Perot to participate in the debates, and he was polling at virtually the same levels as he had been in 1992, and yet this time, he was excluded. Why? Because this time, the Democratic and Republicans decided it was not in their interests. \\\\n\\\\nBob Dole desperately wanted to keep Perot out because he thought, rightly, that Perot was siphoning more votes from him. Meanwhile, President Clinton, who was running for reelection, wanted to minimize public viewership of the debates. He was winning by 20 points in the polls, and he didn\\'t want anything to change the dynamic of the race. They reached an agreement where they cancelled 1 of the debates, so they reduced it from three to two, they banned follow-up questions from the debates so no one could challenge the president\\'s answers, and they scheduled the debates opposite some of the world series playoffs in baseball.\\\\n\\\\nThe CPD allowed the candidates to dictate the terms, and the candidates served their interests, not the public\\'s. The CPD basically just serves as a shield to block the candidates from the public\\'s outrage and criticism. A poll after the election found that 82 % of the public blamed the commission, not the Democratic or Republican nominees. Now, to avoid allegations of impartiality on the CPD\\'s part, they\\'ve simply established the insanely high threshold of 15% pre-debate polling to determine who is allowed to participate in the debates. \\\\n\\\\nTL;DR: The Commission on Presidential Debates is a farce to protect the major candidates from 3rd party opposition. The criteria for participation is purposefully set high to avoid any real challenges from outside parties.\\\\n\",\"373\":\"This is one of those things that honestly shouldn\\'t be getting downvoted.\\\\n\\\\nIt\\'s news, it\\'s about a current US presidential candidate, and yet it still sees downvoting because people vote on emotion.\",\"374\":\"Not every horse can win the race.
