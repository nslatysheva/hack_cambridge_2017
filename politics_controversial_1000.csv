If so, even around 30% of non-Trump supporters are racist. Rather than write off a third of the country as irredeemable, we might want to think about what we're saying.

For example, there is clear statistical evidence that black Americans (vs. white Americans) have a lower employment rate, higher violent crime rate, and lower average IQ. Now, many people (myself included) would point out that those numbers are misleading in many ways--they fail to take into account historical disadvantageous, racially biased policing, standardized test questions may be racially biased, etc. But all of that nuance is lost in a yes/no question. So, if you ask Joe Schmo if blacks are more criminal than whites, and he responds in a way that's consistent with crime statistics he's seen on the news, is he really a racist?"

What’s sad is that the media is focused on the birther issue when it’s only half of the story. Trump has also questioned Obama’s faith and his loyalty to the United States. I have quotes on those topics if anyone’s interested.**

Let's have a real conversation about the candidates, their track records, and their policies. Few things in this article are simply incorrect:

- The Chicago Tribune editorial board hasn't gone insane. It's possible to support a candidate other than Clinton and not be insane.

- Johnson's view on climate change is the consensus of the scientific community. It ""probably is"" anthropogenic. Scientists don't talk in absolutes.

- Johnson's views on abortion have been 100% consistent that it is the women's right to choose.  

- The ballot includes more than two candidates. As the Chicago Tribune's editorial discussed, even when a candidate loses they can still have an impact on future policy. They mentioned that Ross Perot's relative success as a budget hawk cause Bill Clinton to be more fiscally conservative and produce the last balanced budget we've seen in 15+ years. Since Salon read the headlne and decided the editorial board was insane I guess they didn't make it that far."

1. Clinton set up a personal email account and used it for work. Even though previous Secretaries of State did the same thing, and even though thousands of people in government use personal emails for work, she still shouldn’t have done it. She may have violated department policies, but there’s no evidence she broke any laws.

2. Clinton has said it was a mistake and apologized for it.

3. There were concerns that her email server could have been vulnerable to hacking from a foreign power. But it does not appear to have been hacked.

4. None of the work-related emails she sent and received were marked classified at the time. However, some 200 of them were retroactively classified. This is now the subject of a spat between the State Department and the intelligence community, which classifies many things that people elsewhere in the government think are absurd to classify.

5. For Clinton to be charged with mishandling classified information, she would have had to knowingly passed such information to someone not authorized to have it — like David Petraeus showing classified documents to his mistress — or acted with such gross negligence that people without authorization were bound to see it. According to what we know, neither of those things happened.

6. The FBI is investigating the matter, but has said that Clinton herself is not a target of that investigation, meaning that they don’t suspect that she committed any crime.

7. That former aide, Bryan Pagliano, has been granted immunity by the Justice Department and is working with them as they complete their investigation, which will probably conclude this spring.

Going into this race about a year ago, I knew that any alternative to Hillary Clinton from the Democratic side was going to be a rather long shot. She certainly has had a lengthy career and the political acumen to go with it, and all else being equal, there would be no question as to who I would be voting for.

However, all is not equal. I did not anticipate Donald Trump becoming the leader of the GOP and unloading his flavor of ambiguous yet vicious trolling that would make Nathan Poe (the originator of Poe's Law) blush. His nationalistic rhetoric is taken from a playbook used about 75 years ago to justify unspeakable horrors. He clearly has no regard for the well-being of the American people or the image that we project abroad, and is more than willing to sell whatever principles and establishments we have left to enrich himself and the misguided upper crust who supports him.

I also did not anticipate Bernie Sanders to gain such popularity, especially with my generation. Though I do not agree with all of his viewpoints, his honesty, tenacity, and general goodwill seemed to leave all other presidential candidates in the dust. He presented us with some hard truths about the direction this country has been heading in, and offered solutions that would have been implemented with enthusiasm if this were almost any European country instead of the United States.

He had my vote in the primary. He lost. One brand of reasoning dictates that I should vote for Hillary Clinton solely to prevent Trump from taking over, if for nothing else.

I will not be doing so because she does not deserve my vote.

Someone who changes viewpoints on critical issues to suit public opinion with little intent of following through with legislation does not deserve my vote. Someone who takes money from major industries and wealthy donors for favors and future positions does not deserve my vote. Someone who lies to the people and to Congress on mishandling classified information, barely skating out of an indictment, instead of admitting it and rectifying the situation as quickly as possible, does not deserve my vote. Someone who hires curators to manufacture support and stifle oppositional discussion on social media does not deserve my vote. Someone who conspires with party leadership to subvert another candidate's chances, then hires the conspirator into her own campaign after she is ousted, does not deserve my vote.

Let me make it clear that I do this knowing that a Trump presidency would be disastrous. However, as a whole, Clinton's actions are wholly and completely disqualifying for a purported leader of the free world. I have no trust that she is capable of setting aside her own ambitions and following the will of the people. Were it not for Bernie demonstrating that trustworthy politicians do in fact exist, I would have swallowed my pride in resignation that this is the way of politics. My mind is now made up otherwise.

If Hillary loses, do not blame it on people like me. Blame it on Hillary for having all tact, wherewithal, and integrity succumb to greed. I will likewise not blame you if you vote for her because that is your choice, as this is mine. In fact, if you do believe in her, I would encourage you to follow through, because I support all participation in the political process.

With all that said, my vote will be cast for Jill Stein this November.

EDIT: Thank you for the gold, kind stranger!"

This is mostly a medical discussion argument, but I wanted to distill down the pure fundamentals of the argument, regardless of who the person is.  What follows is a purely objective discussion based on medical facts in the context of the video we have of HRC:

First Parkinson's is a disease affecting your motor/movement processes.  Look it up online to see complete explanations or videos.

* ""Coughing spells"": Parkinson's patients die from aspiration pneumonia because they lose movement coordination of their esophagus.  Think of having reflux all of the time and that hanging out around your airway.  I think it's true that HRC has pneumonia but it's probably aspiration pneumonia or infection related to aspiration pneumonia, not your everyday pneumonia.  That she was allowed to walk around later today hugging kids and that she didn't look visibly sick supports this.  You could hang around people with aspiration inflammatory pneumonia without infecting them, you CAN'T hang around people.  People don't rebound for infectious pneumonia in a few hours (more on this further down). 
* ""Weakness"": I think this is autonomic dysfunction. This is where I differ from other people and I haven't seen this brought up by others.  Parkinson's also affects your ability to maintain normal blood pressure and can give you orthostatic hypotension (you stand up and can't maintain blood pressure to your brain, which leads to confusion and essentially passing out).  I think today's episode is our first support for this Parkinson's autonomic dysfunction effect.  That she was able to rebound so quickly is also in support because orthostatic hypotension related to Parkinson's is intermittent and can be rectified/treated.  Sometimes you can just run a high blood pressure to help with this but she's on blood thinners and any doctor wouldn't want to run her at a high blood pressure because of risk of hemorrhage into the brain; if she was on blood thinners then bleeding into the brain would be catastrophic.
* ""Seizures"": I think these are movement disorders. Plenty of people have chalked this up to seizures but she doesn't really have the normal confusion after seizure, I think there is something less dramatic going on.  The types of movement abnormalities she's demonstrated would be more in line with Parkinson's which you're not going to have residual deficits for.
* Chronicity: Treated Parkinson's patients steadily decline and then start a rapid decline after years of treatments.  I think we are just starting on the rapid decline.  That she is having vehicle modifications and that her staff seem so coordinated in dealing with her episodes makes me think this is not a new thing.  This would support a more chronic disease process.  
* Avoiding public appearances: Treatment of Parkinson's involves an ebb-and-flow of being functional and non-functional.  Using medication you can ramp yourself up for special events to make yourself functional but you can't do this for a prolonged period of time successfully.
* Wikileaks October Surprise: A simple email to/from any friend, relative, or doctor that looks into Parkinson's treatment; a medical record; anything that mentions Parkinson's and she's done.  It would take 1 email from her doctor to slip through the cracks and her presidential career would be over.  

tl;dr I think HRC has Parkinson's and what we saw today is just a gradually worsening manifestation of her disease (see autonomic dysfunction)."

I seriously wouldn't put faith in any source right now. I'm also guessing that CNN's source is the same one that said there is no evidence her server was ever hacked - which could be true, but seems unlikely. 

Ultimately, Clinton shouldn't want this either. She is playing it smart and not commenting on it at all. 

I treat this like the unconfirmed Daily Caller source yesterday about the interview happening today. This is an entirely possible, if not probable outcome - but until other sources start confirming it independently, be wary. "

>In late July, one of these scientists—who asked to be referred to as Tea Leaves, a pseudonym that would protect his relationship with the networks and banks that employ him to sift their data—found what looked like malware emanating from Russia. The destination domain had Trump in its name, which of course attracted Tea Leaves’ attention. But his discovery of the data was pure happenstance—a surprising needle in a large haystack of DNS lookups on his screen. “I have an outlier here that connects to Russia in a strange way,” he wrote in his notes. He couldn’t quite figure it out at first. But what he saw was a bank in Moscow that kept irregularly pinging a server registered to the Trump Organization on Fifth Avenue.

Is this some sort of private line?

>The researchers quickly dismissed their initial fear that the logs represented a malware attack. The communication wasn’t the work of bots. The irregular pattern of server lookups actually resembled the pattern of human conversation—conversations that began during office hours in New York and continued during office hours in Moscow. It dawned on the researchers that this wasn’t an attack, but a sustained relationship between a server registered to the Trump organization and two servers registered to an entity called Alfa Bank.

and this:

>Tea Leaves and his colleagues plotted the data from the logs on a timeline. What it illustrated was suggestive: The conversation between the Trump and Alfa servers appeared to follow the contours of political happenings in the United States. “At election related moments, the traffic peaked,” according to Camp. There were considerably more DNS lookups, for instance, during the two conventions.

Does anyone know what the deal is with this article? I mean, it's slate, but this looks crazy.

Edit - something an astute reader noted in the article - the NY Times reached out to Alfa Bank about the server connection, but before the Times ever reached out to Trump, the Trump Tower served was deactivated. Credit u/capnpitz for noticing.

Edit - [Clinton campaign just tweeted about the story in detail](https://mobile.twitter.com/HillaryClinton/status/793234169576947712) - credit to u/The-Autarkh for noticing. 

Edit - Guys, if you haven't yet, read the Mother Jones story. It is worse.

Edit - NY Times [reaching different conclusions](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/01/us/politics/fbi-russia-election-donald-trump.html?_r=2) this is potentially less explosive than it initially seemed. *I ain't no shill*, I put in the pro-Trump edits too. From NYT:

>F.B.I. officials spent weeks examining computer data showing an odd stream of activity to a Trump Organization server and Alfa Bank. Computer logs obtained by The New York Times show that two servers at Alfa Bank sent more than 2,700 “look-up” messages — a first step for one system’s computers to talk to another — to a Trump-connected server beginning in the spring. But the F.B.I. ultimately concluded that there could be an innocuous explanation, like a marketing email or spam, for the computer contacts."

Both books, the former written in 2008 and the latter in 2004, attacked Democratic presidential candidates and were criticized for including numerous inaccuracies.[3][4][5]
In other books and columns for conservative websites such as WorldNetDaily and Human Events, Corsi has discussed topics that are considered conspiracy theories, such as the alleged plans for a North American Government, the theory that President Barack Obama is not an American citizen;[6] criticism of the United States government for allegedly covering up information about the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001,[7] promoting the Abiogenic hypothesis of the origin of oil (arguing that oil is produced from chemical reactions in the Earth, in contrast to the general consensus of the scientific community that oil is produced from organic materials, such as zooplankton and algae), and alleged United States support of Iran in its attempts to develop nuclear weapons.[8][9][10]

372,2016-09-27 02:32:49,54o6hw,130,101,54o6hw,U.S. Presidential Debates without candidates Jill Stein & Gary Johnson is a shameful censorship scam,0.57,24.0,0.0,"In 1988, 92, and 96, the Council on Presidential Debates did not use any preestablished objective criteria to determine who participated in the debates. In 1992, Ross Perot was running for president and he had about 7% in pre-debate polls, and the commission wanted him out of the debate. But at the time, President George H. W. Bush was losing in the polls, and he thought he thought that Perot's participation would help him. So his top negotiator sat down with the Clinton's side and insisted that Perot participate. 

Clinton eventually agreed because he didn't want to be seen as excluding a popular 3rd party candidate, but the commission actually fought back. At first, they wanted to limit his participation to just a single debate, but because both Clinton and Bush thought he would serve their interests, he was allowed to join.

Perot climbed in the polls from 7% to 19%, he was widely considered to have won 2 of 3 of the debates, and he obtained millions of dollars in federal funding, and he became the most successful 3rd party candidate since Teddy Roosevelt. 

Fast forward four years to 1996. 76% of the public wanted Perot to participate in the debates, and he was polling at virtually the same levels as he had been in 1992, and yet this time, he was excluded. Why? Because this time, the Democratic and Republicans decided it was not in their interests. 

Bob Dole desperately wanted to keep Perot out because he thought, rightly, that Perot was siphoning more votes from him. Meanwhile, President Clinton, who was running for reelection, wanted to minimize public viewership of the debates. He was winning by 20 points in the polls, and he didn't want anything to change the dynamic of the race. They reached an agreement where they cancelled 1 of the debates, so they reduced it from three to two, they banned follow-up questions from the debates so no one could challenge the president's answers, and they scheduled the debates opposite some of the world series playoffs in baseball.

The CPD allowed the candidates to dictate the terms, and the candidates served their interests, not the public's. The CPD basically just serves as a shield to block the candidates from the public's outrage and criticism. A poll after the election found that 82 % of the public blamed the commission, not the Democratic or Republican nominees. Now, to avoid allegations of impartiality on the CPD's part, they've simply established the insanely high threshold of 15% pre-debate polling to determine who is allowed to participate in the debates. 

TL;DR: The Commission on Presidential Debates is a farce to protect the major candidates from 3rd party opposition. The criteria for participation is purposefully set high to avoid any real challenges from outside parties.

The result of this election was obvious to begin with.  Much like the 2008 election the president was truly decided by the Democratic primary  rather than the general election.     When the Republicans present a candidate that simply can't win there isn't anything to get excited about.

This time around with Trump we see Hillary making rather large errors and still she's pulling ahead.    This isn't a praise to Hillary it simply shows how backwards the Republican party has become it's becoming unrelatable to anyone but the most extreme.   If anyone dissagrees with me on this than let me just point out the internet trolls who massive ""support"" (through they don't really and won't be voting for him) Trump.    Trolls take the most extreme and objectionable stances to get a rise out of others   when you have online trolls on your side you know you're views are not rational nor mainstream.

How about this woman who says Wi-Fi melts kids' brains?,0.54,59.0,1.0,"Her comments are about exposing children's brains to something that needs to be studied more. Organizations who have conducted research in this area agree with continued investigation. She is specifically talking about the importance of research and regulatory agencies.

--


> it is a sensible precautionary approach...to keep the situation under ongoing review (British Health Protection Agency)



> That means that there ""could be some risk"" of carcinogenicity, so additional research into the long-term, heavy use of wireless devices needs to be conducted. (WHO)



> The potential elevated risk of brain tumors after long-term cellular phone use awaits confirmation by future studies. (2008 meta-analysis)



The researchers did not find causal relationships between Wi-fi and negative health outcomes, but they suggest that the subject should continue to be reviewed for long-term data. Continuing to study it seems like a reasonable approach.  There is a big distinction between encouraging wi-fi research and calling to shut it down. Scientists study electromagnetic waves without being accused of quackery.

--


There have been important instances where a substance was promoted as safe based on scientific research; and after years, and sometimes decades, of further study it was determined to be unsafe. (radiation, smoking, lead, etc.) Was it illogical for scientists to continue to question and research causation because it went against the current assumption?

--

My opinion... continued research is beneficial, more information is better than less information.

Straddling the line of fake news and the occasional seed of truth is World News Daily Report. By cobbling together misattributed stolen photographs (and often using extant, long-circulating rumors), World News Daily Report has published several viral claims often preying upon readers’ religious beliefs, including hoaxes about a newly-discovered eyewitness account of Jesus’ miracles, an ancient rumor about chariot wheels found at the bottom of the Red Sea, and a very old yarn about the discovery of giant skeletons reworked as the tale of a coverup perpetrated by the Smithsonian Institution. However, World News Daily Report frequently branches out to science-based fakery, including japes about the destruction of the world’s oldest tree and another about the discovery of a Megalodon shark in Pakistan."

541,2016-09-20 01:41:19,53kt30,49,17,53kt30,Trump and Clinton react very differently to terror incidents. That tells us how they’d act as president.,0.53,10.0,0.0,"The rushing to talk about a bomb (before that was confirmed) and congratulating himself was typical narcissistic Trump. What is far more troubling is how today he has literally attacked the Bill of Rights. He mocked ""freedom of speech"" (so fuck the first amendment) and disparaged the right to counsel and due process (so the fifth, sixth and seventh amendments suck too). He even had issues with giving medical treatment to the bombing suspect (which would violate the 8th amendment). And the way he talked up the wonders of racial/religious profiling sounds like he thinks the fourth amendment should go too. And that was all just from today. 
  
Sure the bombing suspect is an asshole, but this is far from the first time that Trump has shown he has disdain for the Constitution and I find it astounding that the party that is always talking about how sacred it is can go along with this kind of dangerous talk. When you put it all together, it is no surprise that he talks so fondly about leaders like Putin.

“The city is going under and with poverty comes crime and drugs. And he says ‘look at undocumented immigrants taking all our money away’ and ‘the police have to hunt them down because they’re committing all these crimes’… The narrative about race resonates much more strongly than the narrative about economic justice and social class.”"

It's also a fact that at least one of these laptops with the Top Secret information on it was connected to the Internet multiple times.

It's a fact that Clinton lied to the American people when she told them she did not send/receive any classified information on her private server.

It's a fact that the Top Secret information on Clinton's server, and then the laptops, was exposed to potential hacking by hostile foreign actors, and there is no way to prove this information wasn't hacked.

*tl;dr*: Bernie in his 8 years of *executive leadership* increased voter turnout, built parks and community housing trusts, invested in renewable energy (before it was popular), and stood up to big-moneyed empowered interests.

To answer your questions:

1. I don't think Wall St. itself is the straw that breaks the camel's back, but her relationship with Wall St. I think is indicative of her overall trend, at least from what I can see, of being *much* more cozy with empowered establishment big-moneyed interests than someone whom I can really trust to stand up to the bad actors sucking the life out of our economy. If I was comparing her to Trump there'd be no question (in my opinion), but if we're comparing her to someone who, at least on this issue, is almost virginal white...
2. I am sick of hearing about her e-mails. I think it's an over-politicized bullshit issue that has spun way out of control. That being said, I don't think it's insignificant that there is such an issue surrounding her time as Secretary. It reeks of Hillary or some part of her wing being of the opinion that rules don't apply to them. As far as transparency goes, I'd rather have a candidate who is beyond reproach.
3. See the article at the beginning of this post. He got people excited about politics when he was an executive. He made politics work for *people*, not just those in power. He's like a democracy fetishist. He wants you to vote, to have your voice heard in government even if you disagree with him on the issues, *especially* if you disagree with him on the issues. He wants government to be, though this is a fucking trope now, *of* the people, *by* the people, and *for* the people. He's the only one talking about defending and expanding voting rights. He wants us to be a *democracy*, not an **oligarchy**.

edit: PSA to everyone: If you want to tell people why they should vote for Bernie, tell them why they should vote for Bernie, don't tell them why they *shouldn't* vote for Hillary. Beyond because it's just the nice thing to do, telling people they're wrong actually makes them less likely to hear you out and consider your opinion (it's called the Backfire effect).

He said he would talk to the press but, now he's dodging again No one really knows what is going on but, the opposition is calling for him to leave, however, that will never happen.  


His [brother](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bingu_wa_Mutharika) was president before him and died under similar secrecy (side note: he bought a presidential jet, which bankrupted the country in one swoop), leading to a constitutional crisis because the [vice-president](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joyce_Banda) at the time started a new party after they

For example, a listing of folders in the system contains one labeled “Pay to Play” -- a term that Clinton’s opponent, Republican nominee Donald Trump frequently uses to characterize Clinton’s relationship with the foundation’s donors -- and one that a major foundation would be extremely unlikely to use even in internal communications.


>Additionally, it contains a spreadsheet supposedly detailing the contributions to Democratic politicians from major banks, alongside the amount of money each was supposed to have received from the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) that was implemented to help the financial services industry recover from the Great Recession. Guccifer 2.0 suggests that it is a list of, effectively, kickbacks, kept. Again, it seems highly unlikely that a spreadsheet like that would be created by a political party, and there is no clear reason why it would be on the Clinton Foundation’s website in the first place.

I like Jill, I do.   

But I swear I'm starting to lose respect for her.   

We are talking about a global issue here. [We are already experiencing the results of Climate Change](http://www.usatoday.com/story/weather/2016/09/20/earth-hottest-summer-record/90731548/) and it is only going to get worse.  

There is a risk of electing a climate denier as president that not only wants to defund the EPA but [pull us out of climate agreements](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/05/27/donald-trump-ill-cancel-paris-climate-agreement-and-stop-all-pay/) that were formed with other nations in attempt to deal with the issue.

This is not like the chance of a Republican getting elected who just wont do anything.  The one running actually wants to -set us backwards- by stopping and pulling out of whatever advancements we have already made.  

We can't afford to do that.    

Jill needs to get off her highhorse and respect the fact that some of us would like to make sure that whoever wins, its not someone who wants to tear the environment and apart and make our lives worse then it already is.  

Yes.  We get that the green party has a good platform.  Yes. We get that voting by morality is important.  But no.  Would like to live and cannot afford to even risk the fallout of dropping all efforts of dealing with the environment for the next 4 years,  dropping attempts to fix things,  and giving companies free reign to gut the planet further to their hearts content.  Things are bad enough as it is, so no. Just no."

I could believe Comey just fucked up the wording of the letter and the GOP Congress inevitably took 2 + 2 and added it up to 47.

If that's the case though you get out in front of the cameras and howl down the politicising of a simple advisory and the jumping to conclusions ahead of any actual work by the Bureau.

That Comey has not done this speaks volumes, either to character or intent.  None of it is flattering."

I'm calling for a #Greenexit over these disgusting abuses by Stein and her corrupt party officials."
